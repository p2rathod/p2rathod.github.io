Learning from Yogis.

There is something about the yoga and mediation instructors that is intriguing. The ones I’ve crossed paths with are:

a) Students themselves, investing weeks out of the year to spend time with their teacher or guru. They are never finished.
b) Identity: They’re clear and deliberate in designing their lives congruent with their values, needs, and wants.

* identity
  --- in advertising or on wall st.
  --- we met Paul in Kenya and Olivier in Japan -- both ex-pats living in various parts of the world. Both, choosing to do so.
  --- after years, practicing yoga, as a side hobby
  --- then investing more and becoming a teacher
  --- eventually dropping life in the West to find a more fun, interesting, and intriguing calling - yoga and meditation in another part of the world
  --- sometimes identity finds you. it shifts with you. it moves with you. and it evolves with you. sometimes it starts off as a small hobby, growing over time into all there is. that's when you're the most at peace. you've designed your life in a way that is deliberate.

* students
  --- imagine, starting your journey, immersing yourself into a craft. Imagine working on it for a decade, teaching visitors, or having committed students yourself.
  --- imagine even after all of that, you yourself have a teacher. Someone you're learning from, not from afar, but in immersive training over a week, four to five times a year. Imagine how much better you'd both beach, both teacher and student.
  --- This is the life of the yogi's I've met. They're so incredibly committed to their craft, that they're never complete. They just keep learning, going deeper and deeper. I love that.
  --- Imagine this is what our western world was like -- committing yourself to coding, product management, marketing, sales, for weeks at a time, in a way that provided step changes in your repertoire. This is the type of professional learning that gives me chills.

The yogis' have taught me what congruency of life and identity are as well as what committment to learning is. These, along with the relationships is what I'm taking away.

There are two yoga retreats in particular that I’d recommend anyone (and everyone) go to.

1.  [Watamu Tree House](http://www.treehouse.co.ke), Watamu, Kenya (near Malindi and Mombasa)
2.  [Nishiawakura Yoga Retreat](https://www.bookyogaretreats.com/nokishita-toshokan/2-days-affordable-meditation-and-yoga-retreat-okayama-japan), Nishiawakura, Japan (near Osaka)

## Watamu

We spent 4 days and 3 nights in Watamu, Kenya, an Italian vacation destination - yes you read that right -- tonnes of local pizza, gelato, and paninis in the city. It was incredible. The staff at the TreeHouse first take you to your room that peers onto the ocean, forest, or blue sky depending on which room you’ve chosen. Every meal was fresh, delicious, and made from ingredients found locally. It was the perfect. The trip included water excursions (paddle boarding, river float, and others) as well as yoga (in the yoga room, or on a paddle board), and a mediation.

There’s a lot to learn from the team at Watamu Tree House.

## Nishiawakura

While in Japan we took a 2-day-1-night retreat at a BnB that offered yoga classes as well. Turns out, we were staying with a family - Olivier is from Guadalupe and his wife Harumi is from Japan. They met while in London and have two boys who were 8 and 10. They live in their grandfather’s house (now renovated) in the country side of Japan - which is incredibly beautiful - a welcome retreat from the burgeoning cities of Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto.

Harumi works as an English instructor and tour guide and knows the town very well. Olivier runs a yoga studio and also teaches in India and Thailand. What I found most intriguing about this couple was how they hustle, calmly, and as a team.

They're working multiple jobs, but still have found time to move their entire family (annually) to India, putting their kids in an international school there. They have a bakery they've opened and deliver bread across the country every week. They run English classes and tours in the country side. They’re busy but they make it work. They get to connect with new people, doing what they love to do. Impressive.
