title: The Year, 2% at a Time

Each week represents ~2% of the year. That is HUGE. And it took a pretty rudimentary question from a friend for me to have figured this out. 

At the end of 2014, I was on a date. The girl asked me what my best year had been so far and I had said 2008. It was the year I graduated, had gone on a road trip across the US, went to Europe, my brother got married, and I had started working at a startup as a co-founder. Things were better than good. But it bugged me that 6 years had passed - that I couldn't say that 2014 was the best year of my life. 

As I mustered on why 2014, 2013 or any year after 2008 wasn't the "best" year, I realized that I had reacted to the question. December is generally a time of reflection and I had spent that year reacting. But at almost 30, I knew myself and knew that I could build a system that worked towards an incredible year. A system that reflected where I was in my life, and what I valued. A system that was in-line with my values around growth and learning. I could proactively build the best year of my life.

It's now been 6 months on the 2% and the results are fantastic. I am happier, more focused, and have leveled up my ability to think about systems. The 2% has changed my life, so far. It's now time to reflect on teh system, shift if necessary.

In January, my system consisted of:
* Relationships (family, various groups of friends)
** Here I wanted to ensure I kept in touch through activity and hyper focused
* Trips + Vacations: I created a yearly quote of weekend trips and minimum week-long trips. 
* Outdoor/Active Acitivities: Knowing that the nature, activity, and the outdoors clears my mind and resets my body, I created a once/wk quota to do something active.
* Books: I had a quota of 6 books, and am already on my 5th of the year.


What I realized thus far is the system was missing a career element. It's at the halfway point that I'm adding this in.

Career is driven by learning (which is the reason I LOVE product management - you get to learn for a living). I'm going ot learn most from other people's experience and that means meeting and talking to folks. Some people call this "networking" - a word I've always hated. If I want to learn though, I have to be out there, connecting, learning. It's likely what I will add to the system. Having a meaningful conversation with someone outside of the core group (be it coworkers, friends, family, etc) per week.


Too often life is reactive. There are things we can't control, but there are too many things we can. Why not build urgency to have fun, learn, grow, and be fulfilled. This post by Sheryl Sandberg taught me that https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10155617891025177:0). So far, this year is being set up as one of the best. That (at least, in part) has to do with the approach; the 2%.
