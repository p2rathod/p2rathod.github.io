description: Why it takes so long to clear your blindspots.

Everyone has blindspots. We have maps of how we think the world works. But as we ought to know, but often forget, the map is not the territory. Our perspective is only one truth.

Seeking truth is asymptotic.

First and foremost, let's level set. Our blindspots are plentiful. What I'm explaining here is how we might clear blindspots that limit us from our goals.

What is a blindspot? It's what we don't know, that might be limiting us from achieving the next 'level' in our respective journey. That journey might be achieving a promotion or finding the next step in our entreneurial journies. It might finding bliss within our families. It might be achieviing mental, physical, and physioligical balance. Any time we feel we're hitting a glass ceiling, it's often a blindspot that's limiting us. It's a gap in our belief system of how something works.

Let me give you a few examples. All you have to do is work hard to be successful. Well, that's not true. There's a lot more that goes into it. Heere's anothher one: I just need to meditate to feel balanced. How about another one: If I make enough money, I'll be happy. All of these are common belief systems. Each provides a perspective on a result, but as we know - no goal is ever achieved with single-faceted activity.

Why am I talking about belief systems?
Belief systems are what drive results. This is what separates the good from the great. Whether you're in a rut, lost, anxious, incredibly succcessful, happy, or joyous - your belief system is where all of that stems from.

So if we can agree that results stem from belief systems, then how do we adjust our belief systems to achieve stronger results?

Before I get into understanding, adjustiing, and integrating new belief systems, we have to first speak about motivations structures.

When I feel like I'm hitting a glass ceiling, I have to re-look at my belief system and question it. What I've found constantly is that my glass ceiling is largely anchored in the motiviatoin structure. I ask myself why I'm trying to achieve the thing I'm trying ot achiieve. And therein lies the answer.

Our motivation structures follow a pyramid scheme. They begin in the red, and end in the black. Motivation structures follow a spectrum, moving from a wide, negative, base to a specific, singular point.

Negative motivation is largely comes from a negative place. Perhaps you're comparing yourself to a peer. Perhaps you're unhappy with where you're at. It usually sounds like this: "I want to havee a better job" or "I want to make more money". It might be "I want to have a better marriage." It might be "I want to have a greaet life". Another example - "I want to be skinnier" or "I want to be stronger". The examples are infinite. The problem with all of these si that they're anchored in negativity. They are relative. And from the get-go, you're behind. That often means that you'll settle to when you get to good enough. You're happy when you get to 0 when you start from -10. Let me put it another way: You're paying not to lose. These goals are vague, and it's because you truly don't care.

Positive motivation sets the reference at the tip of the iceberg. It sounds like "I want to be a manager at this store, by this date". "I want ot make $X by age 40". "I want to go on 30 dates every year". "I want learn about X topic so that I can do Y by Z date". So on and so on. The goal is clear, specific, and measurable. Positive motivation structures don't care where you're starting. They are audaccious. They only care where you end up. They also don't care hoow you ccompare to others. They are singular. They are not relative.

Questioning your motivation structure as it relates to your goals is step 1. Why do you want to do what you're doing. Is that the right reason to do it that thing that you are seeking. Is the why long-lasting or fleeting?

Here's the rub. There is limited space at the peak of the pyramid. So you can be good enough at plethora of things. You're only going to be great at a few things in your life. What are those things? Be audacious. Pay attention to your energy. Are you here because you want to feel better? Are you here because the topic you're working on inspires you. Is what you're doing inspiring yourself? What do you want out of this? Why?

Negative motivation stems from the Ego <> Esteem grid. On one axis, you have Ego vs Humbleness and on the other you have High Self-Confidence and Low Self-Esteem. Negative motivation stems from low-self-esteem, high-ego quadrant. **Explore this more**

**For me, it's unblocking the people around me from doing their best work. I was built to understand people, their behaviour, decision making, and ot to unblock them from being their goals. What does that mean, in practice? What are the speciific goals? What are the specifics? Why me? - insane optimism. The maximum is balance. A belief that you can have it all. A willingness to eexperiment. A belief that people are beinigs to be discovered. The calm and collected nature. The willingness to ask questoins. The curiousity and willingness to dig into data. A systems level thinking. An Engineers mindset - all problems can be solved. I wan to unblock by leading, and by supporting. I want to assist the right people, and show how to take ethe last shot and win. I want to teach, by doing, and showing. Hard conversations - easy life. Why? For me - it's always been about relevance. It was the biggest void, being the youngest in the family. I didn't matter. And that's why I can help.**

Bliind spots are emotional? It's anchored in the attachcment to the how. You also don't know what you don't know.
To unccover blindspots is to:

1. Decide on your goals around life. What are your professional, family, and personal goals. What does the 5-yr plan, life plan, look like.
2. Recalibrate your motivational system. Is there enough of a void in the why, for this to drive you to achieve your goal?
3. Uncover your belief system.
4. Seek out coaching. Seek out secondary and tertiary perspectives. Be vulnerable.
5. Re-establish your belief systems.

VOID:

- Freedom - wasn't enough.
- Relevance, is something I grew up with. I wasn't

##Uncovering Your Belief System##
Belief systems are natural, and organic. They are biological. They are the answer to "how". How do you think the world works? How do you think you're going to achcieve your goal? Are you trying to achieve a goal, feeling like you have the one tool that you're trying to brute force with? That's your belief system at work.

Our maintenance cycle is caused by our belief system. Do you ever find yourself 'auto-reactiing', almost uncocciously? Be it getting angry, frustrated, or overwhelmed at similar situations. It's beacause we haven't accepted the situation as the reality. We haven't accepted responsibility for it. And we haven't understood that it's anchohreed iin our emotional belief system.

Belief systems drive results. Think about placebos. Placebos work, as studies suggest. Man is what he believes.

Belief Systems can be defined by these three parts:

1. Core principles
2. Core activities
3. Stories we tell ourselves - proof points.

Core Principles: Every religion relies on a set of core principles. In life, these are the core attributes of what how we think the world around us works. In religion, one might think that if we are "non-violent", that we may create enough good karma to achieve a positive result in the after life (or next life). In work, one core principle might be to "work hard" in order to realize more salary or a higher status.

Core Activities: Like religion, many traditions or activities are prescribed. These are our habits. This is how we spend our time. Some examples might be wakiing up early, or exercising every morning, or sleeping X hours. These are activities we partake in. It serves as validation on whether your activities align with your principles. They serve as an indicator of your true belief system and core principles. For example, you may think that getting 8 hours of sleep is critical to your health. However, if you're constantly getting 5, it serves as an indicator that though you may think sleep is a core principle, it either hasn't been internalized and integrated, or there is a competing priority that inhibits your ability to integrate that principle. A common example is maximizing your productivity, which may be competing with your sleep principle.

Stories: The stories we tell ourselves from our own past or someone elses serve as the proof points for our core principles and activities. Like religion, using stories is a great way to motivate yourself. They're important. It's why people tell you to celebrate the small wins. These are your proof points. Pay partiicular attention to who the protagonist is in your stories though. If they're anyone else but you, then you risk comparing yourself against someone elses benchmark. Your belief system should have proof points from your own life. You are your own inspiration.

What are your principles?
Core activities -- validate your that you are living by those principles
Ask why that belief is good, adn why it's bad
Ask how that belieef has provided postiive and negative outcomes
Ask when that belief beccame a belief first.
Accknowledge that you don't know, that there are many ways to get to where you want to go.
Create a list of those paths.
Add one path to your belief.

The Biochemistry of Belief:

Findings of carefully designed research indicate that our interpretation of what we are seeing (experiencing) can literally alter our physiology. In fact, all symptoms of medicine work through our beliefs. By subtly transforming the unknown (disease/disorder) into something known, named, tamed and explained, alarm reactions in the brain can be calmed down. All therapies have a hidden, symbolic value and influence on the psyche, besides the direct specific effect they may have on the body.

- Homeostasis: belief systems are constantly striving towards reaching a state of equilibrium. This is a state in which the elements of the system only have contradictions that do not affect the stability of the system as a whole. A state of relative congruence.
- Self-regulation: belief systems have the capability to adapt themselves to the external conditions in which they are placed. In that sense, the system is capable of reaching a state of congruence regardless of the circumstances through a constant feedback mechanism between internal beliefs and external factors.
- Autopoiesis: belief systems are capable of reproducing and maintaining themselves. This goes beyond the capability of mere self-regulation in the sense that it has the ability to change quite significantly and become significantly more complex as part of this process.

Personas are great. They're incredibly important in making the right product decisions over time.

When done right, here's what happens:

- Entire product strategies shift to solve 'acute' user problems.
- Engineers make customer-centric decisions when making code and architecture decisions.
- Customer success teams help solve a customer's deeper needs.
- There is unity among the account, customer success, engineering, and product teams. It means that the organization is more likely to move forward together in lockstep. It leads to a concept I like to call 'organizational flow.'
