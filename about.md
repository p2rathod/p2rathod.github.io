### I’m a Co-Founder and VP of Product at [Polar](http://polar.me).

Here, you’ll find some of my research, posts about product management and entrepreneurship, as well as some of the values I hold near.

I currently help build a suite of advertising and content distribution products for premium publishing clients. I’ve been working exclusively with premium media companies like [Oath](http://oath.com), [Gannett](http://gannett.com), [News Corp](http://newscorp.com), and [Telegraph UK](http://telegraph.co.uk) since 2008.

Between 2008 and 2013, I had the pleasure of building the first iOS apps for [Time Magazine](http://time.com), [CNNMoney](http://money.cnn.com/), [Sports Illustrated](http://si.com), [The Toronto Maple Leafs](https://www.nhl.com/mapleleafs/) and [TalkSport](https://talksport.com/) (all rated #1 in their respective categories). In total, I helped [Polar](http://polar.me) build a platform to deliver over 1200 apps across 5 mobile and tablet platforms.

During our ten years in business, I’ve helped usher us through 2 really tough pivots and have worked with over 150 talented individuals in Toronto, New York, London, and Sydney.

In 2008, I graduated from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) (Electrical Engineering, Management Sciences). I spent internships at [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com), and [PARC](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)>) where I worked on supply chain optimization and [a mobile recommendations platform](http://www.izix.com/pubs/Bellotti-Magitti-CHI2008.pdf), respectively.
