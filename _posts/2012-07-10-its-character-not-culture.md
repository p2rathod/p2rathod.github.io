> Your reputation is in the hands of others. That's what reputation is. You can't control that. The only thing you can control is your character. - Dr. Wayne W. Dyer

We spend the majority of our lives in the office, working towards our dreams and aspirations. Our coworkers become our day-time families. It's important to realize that the way a team works together is equally as important as the work one actually does. Thus, a successful team needs to walk in lockstep. A successful team needs a code. A successful team needs character.

The importance of building character is to build identity; its to develop a culture that's natural to the fabric of the team and create a sense of belonging. It allows a team to push in one direction, in unison.

There are companies that try to build culture without first understanding their character, and it's here where you see a hotchpotch of strategies from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other tech giants. The truth is, the best companies have been able to build culture through character. Looking at some of the top technology companies, its easy to identify the defining characteristic in each of them:

* Facebook: hacker mentality
* Amazon: measurably efficient
* Google: work hard, play hard
* Apple: build beautiful products

The roadmap to success includes having incredibly talented people work together towards a common goal. If you're having trouble building culture, I hope the following the steps will get you out of the mud.

Make it natural. What is common between the founding team? Make a list.
Think about the characteristics that make up that persona and create an environment that embodies that through the tools people use, the office space, everything.
Ensure the founding team and leaders are on the same page and consciously make character a priority
Be consistent.
