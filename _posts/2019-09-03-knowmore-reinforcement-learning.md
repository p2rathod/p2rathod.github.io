description: How we become more aware, learn, and reinforce now, and for the long-term.

I have a bad memory. A terrible one. My wife thinks it’s non-existent :P. Luckily, we built KnowMore. It's the only platform that can create Q&A pairs, generate trivia games, and pull insights from a published piece of online content.

The reality is that with the tonnage of content generated daily, it’s hard to remember anything, let alone keep up. The problem, of course, is remembering yesterday's, last week's, and last month's information. I'm talking about long-term memory. This is what allows you to pattern-match. It allows you to understand trends. It allows you to predict where the world is moving and why markets are shifting. If we can understand patterns, we may be more strategic, less reactive, and far more aware. The opportunities that we create, by having an informed opinion, grounded in reality, are limitless.

Of course, the problem is that our ability to remember is diminishing. According to [Herman Ebbinghaus' 1885 forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) (a study that’s been reinforced every decade since), we forget 95% of what we consume, in just 30 days. We know that one major reason that we’re not remembering is that we’re not reinforcing what we’ve consumed. The knowledge hasn’t been encoded well, nor has it been accepted into our long-term memory. Reinforcement of content takes too long. Who has the time to re-read articles? Nobody.

Remembering concepts is important. The scale embedded in the facts is important. Building compounding knowledge is important. Memory matters.

## Content That Matters

I’ve put my content intake into 4 buckets and use KnowMore’s discovery tool (an email newsletter aggregator) to help me discover content.

Here's how I organize content:

1. **Industry**: Help me understand how markets are shifting so I can make better decisions at work.
2. **Hobbies**: Help me deepen my hobbies and interests to ensure a fulfilled intellectual curiosity.
3. **Connected**: Help me better understand my family and friends' interests and industries, so I can deepen my connectedness.
4. **Locale**: Help me understand what's happening in my community, my city, my province, my country, and globally so I can be better aware of the big stories around me.

## Reinforcing What I've Read

Then I use KnowMore’s trivia game to help me remember the content, concepts, and facts of what I’ve read. We use spacial repetition — or repetition. By playing a quick trivia game, we begin to reinforce the connections our brain has already made. We also encode these facts in a new way (vs. just reading the text).

KnowMore’s learning trivia is the first piece of software of its kind that can pull out insights and Q&A from any piece of online, written content. This has never been made publicly available before, but here we are.

What this means is that KnowMore creates new trivia games based on the content that you’re reading. By playing a quick trivia game, KnowMore helps your brain make connections that you otherwise wouldn’t have. I’m seeing incredible results for myself. In only 30 seconds a day, I’m learning and re-learning. Content is sticking. I’ve hooked it up to my Instapaper account and run through a game every day. My awareness has skyrocketed.

I don’t yet know how to measure memory. Here’s what’s exciting though: Imagine that I could decrease forgetfulness from 95% to 90%, or 85%. In effect, I would double, or even triple my working memory. I would increase my neuro-plasticity.

## KnowMore's Scale

Over the past 3 months, KnowMore has achieved this:

{:.table-striped .table-hover .table-bordered}
| Metric | Statistic | Why it matters |
| ------------------- | :----------: | :---------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Questions Created** | **6,959** | A lot of questions generated as we refine our algorithm. |
| **URLs processed** | **690** | A variety of content being scanned everyday. |
| **Trivia Games Played** | **20** | We're starting to on-board real-world users to play games. |

<br/>

Here are two important use cases:

1. As knowledge workers, we need to pattern match to build a better strategy and ultimately make better decisions. KnowMore helps.
2. As long-term thinkers, we want to decrease the rapid pace at which we lose brain cells as we age (5% of nerve cells in the hippocampus per decade). Reinforcement learning - or rather - using our brain more often, can help. Remember, the hippocampus is where a lot of the encoding occurs (along with the frontal cortex).

KnowMore’s discovery (the email aggregator) and reinforcement platform (the trivia) is something 100+ people use every day.

## Getting KnowMore

At the moment, KnowMore is in a private beta with about 40 users. If you'd like to be a part of it, give me a shout on Twitter or LinkedIn. Users get access to a daily email with the content they care about (KnowMore's discovery app) and twice a week, they'll get a trivia game sent to them based on what they've read over the past 30 days (KnowMore's learning app).

Over time, you’ll be able to track your progress, compete against others (if you wish), and ultimately you’ll be able to remember more, feeding your intelligence.

Now, if you don’t think memory strength matters, then this isn’t the app for you. If you think that this could be helpful, go ahead and shoot me an email. If you’re skeptical, check out one of the demo’s — we create trivia games from feeds of Harvard Business Review, Digiday, and The Toronto Star, as examples.

Most of all, if you’re a professional, a knowledge-worker, or just someone who’s curious, then this might be the right technology for you.

A friend once told me that forgetfulness is the biggest barrier to intelligence. How do you feel?
