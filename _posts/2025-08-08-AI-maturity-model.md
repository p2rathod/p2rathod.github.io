description: A 5-stage maturity model for product leaders to deploy AI and win.

As a product leader, I'm saturated with the promise of AI. We’re sold revolutionary, world-changing platforms in every pitch deck. The hype is real, but so is the gap between that grand vision and our customers’ daily reality.

Our users aren't thinking about "AGI." They're thinking about the mountain of invoices they need to process, the data they have to enter manually, and the tedious, repetitive tasks that drain their day.

Many of us want to build an AI that acts like an autonomous leader from day one. But our customers think of AI in a much more human way: as an employee. You don't hire an intern on Monday and make them a VP on Friday. You hire them, you train them, you supervise them, and you gradually build trust. Only after they've proven their competence on small tasks can you promote them to run the whole show.

The most successful AI products will be the ones that honor this journey. They will meet customers at Stage 1—with a supervised junior assistant—and build a bridge of trust, utility, and value that walks them, step-by-step, to the promised land.

For product leaders, CPOs, and CEOs, our job is to map that journey. Based on my work in complex business automation, I’ve found it critical to use a maturity model to guide product strategy and customer adoption.

Here is a 5-stage AI maturity model, framed through the lens of a common, complex AP workflow:

---

## Stage 1: The Supervised Assistant

This is the "new hire" on their first day. The AI does nothing on its own. It acts as a simple assistant, augmenting a human who remains 100% in control. Trust in the AI is minimal, and it needs constant supervision.

* **The Goal:** The product challenge is all about **UX and validation speed.** How do you present the AI's suggestions? How fast can the user tab through and approve? The UI must be built for seamless human correction, because the human *is* the process. The business value is a direct assault on manual data entry, reducing human error and lowering the cost-per-invoice. This is the first, essential rung on the automation ladder.
* **AP Example:** An AP clerk receives a PDF invoice. The AI scans the document and suggests "Vendor: Acme Inc." and "Amount: $1,200." The clerk must manually review and confirm *every single field* before the bill is created.
---

## Stage 2: The Proactive Contributor

Your employee is now a "junior team member." They're no longer just following instructions; they're starting to see patterns and make proactive, non-obvious suggestions. The human is still the reviewer, but they are now validating *insights*, not just raw data.

* **The Goal:** Your key product challenge is to **build trust by *explaining why*.** You can't just suggest a G/L code; you must show your work (e.g., "You’ve coded 9 of the last 10 invoices from this vendor to 'Marketing'"). This explainability is how you move the user from supervision to trust. The strategic value shifts from basic efficiency to **improved data quality,** which is the foundation for all future automation.
* **AP Example:** The AI extracts all fields from an invoice. Based on past behavior, it also pre-fills the correct general ledger code, department, and project. It suggests, "This looks like a marketing expense for the Q4 campaign. Is that correct?"

## Stage 3: The Autonomous Agent

This is the "senior, trusted team member" you can hand a whole project to. This is the first major leap in maturity. The AI now completes the *entire* task autonomously with a high degree of confidence. It only surfaces exceptions for human review. The user's job shifts from "doer" to "reviewer."

* **The Goal:** The product design challenge flips entirely. It’s no longer about a "to-do list" UI, but a **"review by exception" dashboard.** How do you design the rules engine? How do you give the user the confidence to *not* look at 95% of the items? This unlocks genuine organizational scale, transforming your AP team from data-entry clerks into financial analysts who manage risk and optimize processes.
* **AP Example:** An invoice from a known vendor arrives. The AI validates it against a purchase order, codes it, and schedules it for payment—all without human touch. It only flags the user if the invoice amount doesn't match the PO or if it's from a brand-new, unrecognized vendor.

## Stage 4: The Intelligent Orchestrator

Your trusted senior is now the "department manager." They are no longer just thinking about their own silo (AP) but are orchestrating entire cross-functional workflows. The AI understands the AP process *in context* of the wider business, connecting disparate systems to achieve a broader goal.

* **The Goal:** This is now an **API and platform play.** Your product must have clean, robust integrations. The product challenge is no longer just the in-app UX but the reliability of the system-to-system "conversations" your AI is managing. The product has officially moved from a cost-saving tool to a **decision-making engine** that generates direct, strategic financial value.
* **AP Example:** The AI sees a large invoice come in. It checks the company's real-time cash flow, analyzes the vendor's payment terms, and then proactively suggests *when* to pay that bill to best optimize working capital—balancing early-pay discounts against cash-on-hand.

---

## Stage 5: The Predictive Strategist

This is your "strategic advisor" or "VP." They are no longer just reacting to *present* data; they are *predicting* the future and advising on high-level strategy. The AI has moved from "what is" to "what if" and "what's next."

* **The Goal:** The product challenge is **data storytelling and visualization.** How do you present a complex, predictive insight in a way that is simple, credible, and actionable for an executive? This is your competitive moat. Your product is no longer an automation tool; it is a strategic partner, providing foresight that your competitors cannot.
* **AP Example:** The AI analyzes 24 months of spend data. It generates a report that says: "Warning: Your spend with 'Acme Inc.' has increased 40% quarter-over-quarter, and they are your single source for a critical component. This represents a significant supply chain risk. We recommend you begin qualifying a secondary vendor."

## Walk With Your Customer

The leap from Stage 1 to Stage 5 is exciting. It's what we all want to build.

But as product leaders, we must have the discipline to meet our customers where they are. You can't promote an intern to a VP overnight. Don't try to sell a "Predictive Strategist" to a team still drowning in the manual data entry of Stage 1. You will fail.

The promise of AI is not a single destination; it's a journey of building trust. Start by giving your customers a trustworthy "Supervised Assistant." Earn the right to promote it to a "Proactive Contributor." Build the trust, deliver the value, and walk with them, step-by-step, toward the promised land.

That is how you build an AI product that lasts.
