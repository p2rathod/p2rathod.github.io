Ever be in a room, tune out, tune back in, and nod your head and cover it using "mmm hmmm"? That happened to me, a lot. If half of communication is never saying a word, then I was definitely getting it wrong. As a product manager and co-founder, communication is paramount and it was a tool I didn't have.

Above communication, there were also a tonne of reasons to become a better listener. Here are a few of them:
* Listening has been identified as one of the top skills employers seek in entry-level employees as well as those being promoted (AICPA, 2005; Goby & Lewis, 2000, and more)
* 2/3rds of all malpractice cases were tied to breakdowns in communication (Hickson et. al, 1992)
* Listening is tied to effective leadership (Bechler & Johnson, 1995; Johnson & Bechler, 1998).
* The average person talks at a rate of about 125 â€“ 175 words per minute, while we can listen at a rate of up to 450 words per minute (Carver, Johnson, & Friedman, 1970).


The silver lining: listening is a skill and a skill can be learned.

So I read Active Listening 101 by Emilia Hardman. It's fundamentally changed the way I communicate. It's helped me be better at my job as a product lead and in my personal life as a son, brother, and soon-to-be husband.


![What is most useful]({{site.url}}/images/activelistening.jpg)

Here's what I found to be most useful:

* You learn facts. Once you're out of school, you're going to learn more from what others know than you are from a text book. You listen because you want to learn and being better means you learn more.
* You gain perspective. Through active listening I've been MUCH better about listening beyond the spoken word. I pay greater attention to tone, body language, and environment. I've been able to gain the perspective of the speaker. I've gained empathy.
* You share. I've been able to share in experiences. By actively listening, I understand more about what and why a person is saying what they're saying. I now respond more than I react.

This is a new new super power. I was one of those guys that would listen to a song and never hear the lyrics. I'd lipsync to songs at wedding receptions, but never actually sing them. Now, I understand what Jay-Z is saying in "Interlude" (and why), and finally realize how dirty NEXT's "Dancing Too Close" really was.

If you're looking for a new super power - read Active Listening 101. With practice, it will change your life, like it did mine.
