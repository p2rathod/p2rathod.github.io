Ever be in a room and tune out? How about not truly understanding why someone was saying what they were saying? If half of communication is never saying a word, then I was definitely failing. Active listinening was a tool I simply didn't have. Some of the best leaders I've come across are great communicators and even better listeners. I wanted this skill.

So I read [Active Listening 101](http://www.amazon.com/Active-Listening-101-Communication-Skills-ebook/dp/B008X43TJE) by Emilia Hardman. It's fundamentally changed the way I communicate. It's helped me be better at my job and in my personal life as a son, brother, and soon-to-be husband. I've gained a super-power.

Here's what I "discovered":

* _You learn facts_. Once you're out of school, you're going to learn more from what others know than you are from a text book. You listen because you want to learn and being better means you learn more.
* _You gain perspective_. Through active listening I've been MUCH better about listening beyond the spoken word. I pay greater attention to tone, body language, and environment. I've been able to gain the perspective of the speaker. I've gained empathy.
* _You share_. I've been able to share in experiences. By actively listening, I understand more about what and why a person is saying what they're saying. I now respond more than I react.

This is a new new super power. I was one of those guys that would listen to a song but never hear the lyrics. Now, I understand what Jay-Z is saying in "Interlude" (and why), and finally realize how dirty NEXT's "Dancing Too Close" really is.

If you're looking for a new super power - read Active Listening 101. With practice, it will change your life, like it did mine.

Need some extra motivation to learn this skill. Here's a few:

* Listening has been identified as one of the top skills employers seek in entry-level employees as well as those being promoted (AICPA, 2005; Goby & Lewis, 2000, and more)
* 2/3rds of all malpractice cases were tied to breakdowns in communication (Hickson et. al, 1992)
* Listening is tied to effective leadership (Bechler & Johnson, 1995; Johnson & Bechler, 1998).
* The average person talks at a rate of about 125 â€“ 175 words per minute, while we can listen at a rate of up to 450 words per minute (Carver, Johnson, & Friedman, 1970).
