description: A few observations during an extended vacation - a mini-retirement.
location: All Over The World
---

This past June, I left the company that I co-founded. It had been just over 10 years. For the first time in a decade, I didn't have a job. For the first time since university, I didn't have something in my professional life to look forward to.

I could have jumped right back in, but then I (finally) read the [4 Hour Work Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4-Hour_Workweek) By Tim Ferriss. In it, he talks about taking mini-retirements - the idea of taking time off to reset the mind, body, and soul. To do something new while you still have your health. Convincing argument.

So I decided to be a bum - and thought Ash should too. Co-bumming at 33. This is what adulting is all about.

Here are 5 observations since taking the leap.

### 1. The Decision?

How do I know I made the right decision?

Any resentment, contempt, or regret I thought I might have hasn't come up yet. Just a genuine love for them, for their growth, for their impact on my growth. Any shorter, and I may have asked 'what-if'? Would I celebrate Polar's success? Would I post about their achievements, even when I'm not there? Absolutely. That's how I know I made the right decision. It's pure love.

Here's the other thing:
There is never a good time to leave, but that doesn't mean that any time is good either (as written [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quitting-your-job-taking-time-off-4-observations-sjef-jongen/)). I left when things were good, when the tide was rising. I helped shape that. It meant enough to me to get the ship pointing in the right direction, rather than letting it sink. I think this fundamentally changed the dynamic for the better.

I always admired Michael Jordan for leaving after his 3rd championship [whether it was forced or not](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/131997-mjs-1st-retirement-was-it-a-secret-suspension)! He left when the Bulls were at their best. Not that I'm Michael Jordan nor is Polar the Chicago Bulls - but you get the idea. If you're deciding to leave as a co-founder, leave after you've helped right the ship.

### 2. The Anxiety Without "Next"

> "Leap and the net will appear" - Julia Cameron - The Artists Way

I like that quote. I like to think that it's true.

In that same [article linked above, by Sfej Jongen](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quitting-your-job-taking-time-off-4-observations-sjef-jongen/), he says that talking to people is the best remedy. He's right.

It's not in my nature to be open and trusting by default, but that's exactly what's needed. Fight the urge to be private. It'll make things easier for yourself. Guess what -- it'll also give permission to your partner, friends, and family to do the same.

### 3. Bringing Closure

Quitting, leaving, breaking up - that's 1/2 the battle. The second is closure - a completely different beast. For me, not having closure manifested in really weird ways (like a fixation on one semi-dumb startup idea for months).

I still had Polar tshirts, sweaters, and hats. I even used the water bottle for weeks after I left. This, was a mistake. It reminded me of being at work. It reminded me of something I needed to let go.

So I gave (almost) all my Polar gear away - mostly to my dad. Win-win (he loves free stuff)!

### 4. Paying Attention To The Negative Space

I've done a tonne so far. Here's a quick list:

- Played golf at St. Andrews in Scotland
- Trekked Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania
- Spent time at one of the best yoga retreats globally in Watamu, Kenya
- Surfed in California and hiked some of Yosemite's best trails
- Traveled across Japan, spending time in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, as well as the country side
- Skydived in New Zealand
- Road tripped all along the North and South Island in New Zealand
- Attended The Woodford Folk Festival -- 7 days of music, talks, workshops, and parties
- Scoured the beaches of Australia's East coast

But it's what I haven't done that is the most interesting

- I don't have a home (not even in Toronto). Instead, I'm a nomad (for now).
- I haven't spent time with family or friends, beyond a few catchups and facetime sessions.
- I haven't worked on anything in months.

The power in taking something out of your life, is that you get to decide how to put it back in. Ash and I have a seemingly clean slate. Instead of reacting to what life brings, we get to decide, define, and design it. I'm incredibly excited about working from zero.

### 5. The Relationship With Time

![Beach time]({{site.url}}/assets/images/posts/travel/five-lessons/lavie.JPG "Beach time")

I've removed all routine. I obviously don't have any meetings. I sleep when I'm tired, and wake up when I'm not. I eat when I'm hungry. We make healthy meals. I spend afternoons at the beach, in the water, or reading. Time has nothing on me.

I realized how negative my relationship with time was. So I 'broke up' with it. Obviously it's been amazing.

So how do I stay 'broken up', when work is back in the picture. Something I've used is the idea of flow (personal, communal, and organizational). I've timed it for 90-minutes, using the [Be Focused timer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973134470?mt=12) (but any timer will do). It worked. I no longer look at the time, but rather try to fit in 4-5 90-minute sessions in a day. A flow of 45 minutes isn't enough to get something meaningful done, consistently, and 2-3+ hours is a marathon. 90 minutes is the Goldilocks of flow. Have a read through [The Way You're Working Is Not Working](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7679810-the-way-we-re-working-isn-t-working) By Tony Schwartz for more.

### Final Thoughts

So far, this trip has been nothing short of incredible. I'm addicted and so is Ash. It's changed our perspective on what's important. Our belief systems have changd in ways I didn't expect. I'm working on these changes staying with us when we're back.

I hope you all create the time for a mini-retirement like we've done. Do it while you're young, and when you're old. Do it whether you have a partner or not. This is where growth comes from. Highly recommended.
