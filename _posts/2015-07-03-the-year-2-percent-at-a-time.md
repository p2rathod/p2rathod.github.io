Why are we such reactive creatures? Is it North American culture? Is it me? At the end of 2014, a date (now my wife) asked a simple question: "What was the best year of your life?" I said 2008, the year I graduated from university, had epic trips with some of my best friends, and my the year my brother got married. Any year since then was hard to top.

That REALLY bugged me. I was so annoyed that I couldn't say "this year". I had let the year come to me organically, reactively. _Nothing_ in the previous 12 months could lead me to topping 2008. I went home after that date and was just super-annoyed.

I decided then, that 2015, 2016, and beyond would be different. I would never say that the best year of my life was in the past. It was a goal, and I wanted it. I wasn't going to just sit back and let the year pass me by.

THat's when I came up with The 2% Rule.

The premise is this: We _should_ be able to say that 'this year' was the best year of our lives, every year.

### The Model

We begin with the simple concept: Each week of the year represents ~2% of the year (it's actually 1.923%). With this, we make the 2% count. Let's be proactive. Let's plan for success. Let's build a recipe that aligns with our values and goals, both short term and long term. In December of 2015, I want to answer "this year" when someone asks me that very same question.

I built a system centered on personal endeavors and I'm now reflecting at the 6 month mark. Here, I evaluate what I've done, and what changes I need to make for the latter half of the year:

### The Recipe (circa January 2015):

(Note these are all MINIMUMS)

- 1/week: Outdoorsy/being active
- 1/month: Connect with family with a unique activity (vs. just visiting)
- 1/quarter: Connect with school friends
- 3/half: Weekend trips
- 1/half: 1 week-long vacation
- 3/half: books to read

### The results:

I've been to Panama, Costa Rica, and had weekend trips to Montreal, Canada, and lived in a (treehouse near Lake Scugog)[https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/1782781]. I attended the home opener and Canada day Blue Jay games, and went to Detroit to see the Raptors play. I have forged deeper relationships with both family and friends. I've read some amazing books. I've committed to the system and have reaped its rewards, so far.

#### Grade: B+ (due to lack of professional growth metrics in the system)

### The message

Too often life is reactive. There are things we can't control, but there are far too many things that we can. Why not build a plan to have fun, learn, grow, and fulfill your mind, body, and soul. [This post by Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10155617891025177:0) reminds us of that. Let's commit to the system as [James Clear says](https://medium.com/the-blog-of-james-clear/if-you-completely-ignored-your-goals-and-focused-on-this-one-thing-would-you-get-better-results-1451c43c0c64). This year has been amazing and it's been influenced by the 2% model.

### A quick review - circa 2018

I wanted to touch base here, and follow up on what's happened since that December evening in 2014.

2015:

- I got engaged (to that girl that asked me about my favourite year)
- Travelled a tonne (see above)
- Launched a new product at work

2016:

- I got married (to that same girl)
- Traveled to California, Iceland, Italy, France, DC, Kilarney, and Hawaii
- My title changed to VP-Product Management

2017:

- I launched two new multi-million dollar revenue generating products at work
- I traveled to Iceland (again), a number of smaller weekend trips, Vermont, and ended it with a trip to India
- I lost sight of the 2% for most of the year

2018:

- Experienced a concussion, while in India -- took 2-3 months to recover
- Got my 2% mojo back!
- Voluntarily left my role at the company after a decade as a co-founder
- Played golf at St. Andrews in Scotland
- Trekked Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania
- Spent time at one of the best yoga retreat centres in Watamu, Kenya
- Surfing in California, and hiking at Yosemite
- Traveled across Japan, spending time in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, as well as the country side (beautiful)
- Skydiving in New Zealand
- Spent 2 months driving across New Zealand

The 2% rule works. It forces you to create balance.

I'm now working on a guide book or journal for myself that fits this. There are a tonne of other journals out there - and I've used most of them. I think we should try to use
