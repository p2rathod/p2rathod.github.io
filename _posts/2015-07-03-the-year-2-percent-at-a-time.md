title: The Year, 2% at a Time

Why are we so reactive when it comes to living our day-to-day? Is it North American culture? Is it my culture? At the end of 2014, a date asked me something simple: "What was the best year of your life?". It bugged me that I couldn't say "this year". Nothing in the previous 12 months could lead me to it. Like many others, I reflected on the year in December. I was reactive.

We need to flip the model and we begin with the simple concept: Each week of the year represents ~2%. Let's be proactive. Let's plan for success. Let's build a recipe that aligns with our values and goals, both short term and long term. Let's make the 2% count. 

I built the system centered on personal endeavors and I'm now reflecting at the 6 month mark. Here, I evaluate what I've done, and what changes I need to make for the latter half of the year:

### The Recipe in January: 

(Note these are all MINIMUMS)

* 1/week: Outdoorsy/being active
* 1/month: Connect with family with a unique activity (vs. just visiting)
* 1/quarter: Connect with school friends
* 3/half: Weekend trips
* 1/half: minimum week-long vacations
* 3/half: books to read

### The results:

I've been to Panama, Costa Rica, and had weekend trips to Montreal, Canada, and lived in a Treehouse near Lake Scugog. I attended the home opener and Canada day games for the Toronto Blue Jays, and went to Detroit to see the Raptors. I have increased the quality of relationships on both the family and friends front. I've read some amazing books. I've committed to the system and that's allowed me to have more fun, build deeper relationships, and learn a heck of a lot more. 

#### Grade: B+ (due to lack of professional growth metrics in the system)


Too often life is reactive. There are things we can't control, but there are far too many things that we can. Why not build a plan to have fun, learn, grow, fulfill your mind, body, and soul. [This post by Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10155617891025177:0) reminds us of that. Let's commit to the system and reap its rewards as [this post by James Clear](https://medium.com/the-blog-of-james-clear/if-you-completely-ignored-your-goals-and-focused-on-this-one-thing-would-you-get-better-results-1451c43c0c64) says. This year is  being set up to be one of the best yet. That, at least in part, is a result of making the 2% count.
