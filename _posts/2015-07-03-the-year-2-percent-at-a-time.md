title: The Year, 2% at a Time

Why are we such reactive creatures? Is it North American culture? Is it me? At the end of 2014, a date asked a simple question: "What was the best year of your life?" It bugged me that I couldn't say "this year". _Nothing_ in the previous 12 months could lead me to it. Like many others, I reflected in December. I was reactively taking stock of the year. 

We need to flip the model. We *should* be able to say we've had an amazing year, every year.

### The Model

We begin with the simple concept: Each week of the year represents ~2% of the year. With this, we can make the 2% count. Let's be proactive. Let's plan for success. Let's build a recipe that aligns with our values and goals, both short term and long term. In December of 2015, I want to answer "this year" when someone asks me that very same question.

As such, I built a system centered on personal endeavors and I'm now reflecting at the 6 month mark. Here, I evaluate what I've done, and what changes I need to make for the latter half of the year:

### The Recipe (circa January 2015): 

(Note these are all MINIMUMS)

* 1/week: Outdoorsy/being active
* 1/month: Connect with family with a unique activity (vs. just visiting)
* 1/quarter: Connect with school friends
* 3/half: Weekend trips
* 1/half: minimum week-long vacations
* 3/half: books to read

### The results:

I've been to Panama, Costa Rica, and had weekend trips to Montreal, Canada, and lived in a (treehouse near Lake Scugog)[https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/1782781]. I attended the home opener and Canada day Blue Jay games, and went to Detroit to see the Raptors play. I have forged deeper relationships with both family and friends. I've read some amazing books. I've committed to the system and have reaped its rewards, so far.

#### Grade: B+ (due to lack of professional growth metrics in the system)

### The message
Too often life is reactive. There are things we can't control, but there are far too many things that we can. Why not build a plan to have fun, learn, grow, and fulfill your mind, body, and soul. [This post by Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10155617891025177:0) reminds us of that. Let's commit to the system as [James Clear says](https://medium.com/the-blog-of-james-clear/if-you-completely-ignored-your-goals-and-focused-on-this-one-thing-would-you-get-better-results-1451c43c0c64). This year has been amazing and it's been influenced by the 2% model.
