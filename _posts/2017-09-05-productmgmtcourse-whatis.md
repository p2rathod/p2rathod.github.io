3 themes, 4 responsibilities, and 5 pillars. That's product in a nutshell.

Product managers have a fun and exciting job. We get to learn, to build, and to communicate. We get to work with amazing teams, customers, and users. We have the luxury to be creative and process oriented at the same time. Our jobs can be fluid. We are accountable for driving success in a business line, product, or feature. The responsibilities of a product manager come in many forms. They are a function of the business profile. Some factors include:

- The type of company (consultancy or product oriented)
- The size of the company (large or small)
- The customer, a user or an enterprise

No matter the flavours, three themes stay consistent:

- **Maximizing customer value**
- **Maximizing competitive advantage**
- **Maximizing long-term profitability**

That's exciting. Over the past century, these responsibilities have gone from shared ownership, to singular ownership (more on that in the next post). Not surprisingly, products are better, competitive, and more profitable than they have ever been in part, due to the role and ownership of a product.

### The Four Areas of Responsibility

There are four key areas of responsibility for product managers:

1.  **Domain knowledge:** If you're anything like me, (and taking this course means that you are), you have a thirst to learn. The best thing about being a product manager is that a large portion of your job is to learn as much as possible, as quickly as possible. Domain knowledge is knowing your market, your customers, and your competitors better than they know themselves.
2.  **Strategy Development:** Here is where you test your domain knowledge. The ability to set a vision and strategy is more art than science (at the moment). The hard-skills include the ability to identify a target market, customers, set goals, and define initiatives to reach those goals.
3.  **New Product Launch:** In a startup, youâ€™re constantly launching new products, features, and iterating. The ability to set a roadmap, prototype, test, concierge, and launch a new product is critical.
4.  **Lifecycle Management** Once launched, as a product manager your job is to usher the product and feature set along the product lifecycle. This includes driving adoption, supporting sales and the product, setting pricing, forecasting, and ushering products to obsolescence. As a side note, I find putting product features to rest an incredibly satisfying feeling. Less is more.

This is a lot to ask for from just a few people. Luckily, you're not in it alone. As a product manager, you're connected with sales, marketing, engineering, account management, customers, and users. You work with an organization.

### The Five Pillars: Skills To Excel At Product Management

Covering your responsibilities is part of the ask. To really push the needle, you'll want to work on the soft skills that take you from novice to master. We bucket these skills into four areas. These are:

1.  **Sales:** As you launch new products, drive adoption, and create internal consensus, you'll use your abiltiy to sell.
2.  **Adjacency: Technology And Economics:** As a product owner, you sit between your engineering and business teams. You'll want to be able to be educated with both. You'll want to work with your Engineering team and prototypes yourself. The ability to speak to, and use technology allows you to bring ideas to life. A deeper understanding of the economics of your solution adn market helps you communicate the opportunity in a way that resonates with decision makers. It also gives you a deeper understanding of the market opportunity.
3.  **UX And Psychology:** This is often overlooked. If users don't find your solution intuitive there is little chance that your product will succeed. Skills in information architecture, visual design, and user testing are helpful here. A deeper understanding of human psychology and behavioral analytics will go a very long way in building solutions that are easy to use.
4.  **Project Management:** You're managing your time and the time of others. Projects need coordination between teams. Your ability to stay organized, communicate, and keep everyone informed allows your project to move across teams.
5.  **Data Analysis:** You're analyzing signals to better understand your market, competitors, customers, and users. I name this, excelling at MS Excel (or Google Sheets). Even better is to be able to use MySQL (or other data stores). I can't harp on this enough. Being data driven is foundational to Product Management.

To recap, product managers exist to maximize:

- customer value
- competitive advantage
- long term profitability

There are 4 areas of responsibility:

- Domain knowledge
- Strategy development
- New product launch
- Lifecycle management

There are 5 skills of a Product Manager are:

- Sales
- Adjacency (tech and econ)
- UX (and psych)
- Project Management
- Data Analysis

Hope you can use this as a barometer and framework of how you create demonstrable expertise in product management.
