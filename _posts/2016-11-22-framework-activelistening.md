Face it - you haven't really listened. You're not good at it. Neither was I. Sure, we 'heard' what other people said, but we've often faded, day-dreamed, or fully moved our attention elsewhere more often than not. The struggle is well [documented here](http://pratikrathod.com/long-form/2016/03/23/half-of-communication-is-never-saying-a-word.html)

You're not alone. 75% of people don't actively listen.

It's not because you don't want to. Frankly, it's because you think it's an art, rather than a skill. Well, here's a framework, delivered w/ an example.

The other day, my wife (who's a high school teacher) was telling me about inquiry-based learning. Below is the active listening framework, exemplified by that conversation.

1. Who
Name the person. Who are they? What is their relation to you?

2. Context
What are they trying to convey? An idea? An experience? What brought them to talk about what they're talking about?

3. What
What are they talking about? What are the key points?

4. Body
What's their body language like? How about their tone?

5. Yes, and
The holy-grail - this is all about [yes, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...). How are you going ot build on what's been shared? This might be a question, a new idea, or a rebuttal.

And the final framework:

The result? For one - a far better marriage ;).

Presumably, you've read this far because you see the value in active listening. You're searching to be a better leader, friend, or husband. You want to be better at problem solving and sales. The value is clear, but the path to get there isn't always clear.

Remember, this is a skill - not an art. It can be learned, and learned fairly easily. Below is a worksheet you can use. Good luck.
