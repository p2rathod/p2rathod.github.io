Face it - you haven't really listened. You, nor I are any good at it. Sure, we 'hear' what other people say, but we also often fade, day-dream, or fully move our attention elsewhere. The struggle is well [documented here](http://pratikrathod.com/long-form/2016/03/23/half-of-communication-is-never-saying-a-word.html).

I learned that I wasn't alone. 75% of people don't actively listen.

It's not because I didn't want to. Frankly, it's because I thought it was an art, rather than a skill. Here's my framework, which helps me listen, empathize, and respond.

The other day, my wife (who's a high school teacher) was telling me about [inquiry-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry-based_learning). Below is the active listening framework, exemplified by that conversation.

1.  Who
    Name the person. Who are they? What is their relation to you?

2.  Context
    What are they trying to convey? An idea? An experience? What brought them to talk about what they're talking about?

3.  What
    What are they talking about? What are the key points?

4.  Body
    What's their body language like? How about their tone?

5.  Yes, and
    The holy-grail - this is all about [yes, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...). How are you going ot build on what's been shared? This might be a question, a new idea, or a rebuttal.

And the final framework:

The result? For one - far better relationships ;).

The value is clear, but the path to get there isn't always clear. I had to remind myself of a growth mindset. It's a skill - not an art. It can be learned, and learned fairly easily. Below is a mental worksheet I use. Good luck.
