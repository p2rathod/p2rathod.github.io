title: Digital Advertising - Clarity in Purpose

Today, ad budgets are driven by channel, be it print, display, TV, or other. It’s why we talk about TV and Digital as 2 separate buckets, or video, YouTube, sponsored content, and banner ads all in the ‘digital ad mix’. There is a misalignment of budget allocation and campaign goals in the digital ad world. On the publisher end, we see payments by creative type and channel, not by campaign goals such as brand awareness or direct response.

This, (I believe) causes much of the confusion around campaign success, perceived ROI, and metrics that matter. A misalignment between dollar allocation and brand goals produces incoherent digital ad strategies across advertisers, agencies, and publishers. 

We need to rethink how we view digital advertising. We need to align our budgets, and strategies by purpose and goals rather than by creative, channel, or existing expertise.


A new model for digital advertising:

Let’s begin with providing a general context for how creatives and channels apply against purpose; In general, we will seek one of two goals as part of any digital ad campaign; brand awareness or direct response.

Clarity in this model leads us to a strategy around digital advertising. One that helps people choose, and helps people buy, allowing advertising to reach new audiences, target a segment, and convert the user that is most likely to engage. This process, I like to call our digital advertising value chain:

With this funnel, we find clarity in outcomes and goals across our ecosystem of advertisers, agencies, publishers, and even technology vendors. Here, the digital advertising funnel provides a framework for where agencies, vendors, and partners can work together. Here, campaigns can align themselves by purpose, be it build broad awareness, speak to a segment, or convert a ‘user’. Ultimately, with this framework, we see a clear path towards defining ‘ROI’.

 

What this means:

Let’s rebuild the digital ad mix against 3 goals (awareness, engagement, conversion) and across success metrics and how best to enable the ecosystem (crossing the chasm).

Awareness

* Success Metrics: Reach, Attention
* Ecosystem: Audience Identification

Engagement

* Success Metrics: Engagement
* Ecosystem: User scoring and identification. Input into DSM's for retargeting.

Conversion

* Success Metrics: Click Through Rate
* Ecosystem: Attribution (against awareness and engagement campaigns)
 

This framework helps us align a system of advertisers, agencies, publishers, and vendors. It ultimately helps our customers build awareness, engage an audience, and/or convert a user.
