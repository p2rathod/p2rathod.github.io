> "Pole-Pole" - Slowly Slowly

A slow walk would be too fast for this mountain. One step -- breathe -- another step -- breathe. On and on for 7 straight days and nights. That was our ascent up Mount Kilimanjaro - Africa's tallest peak, and the highest free-standing mountain in the world. It had always been a dream and this year I had the opportunity to do it with 18 family and friends. There was only one way up -- "pole-pole" -- slowly slowly in Swahili.

# SURPRISE! It's a doozy.

I did very little prep (luckily, we had some very solid organizers) and even less training. I thought I knew enough from the anecdotes of others. Besides, reading too much would have killed the surprise. Yeah, I should have killed the surpirse.

The first blunder was the sleeping bag fiasco (my oversight). Instead of getting a -30 celsuis grade sleeping bag, I ended up with one that barely survived summer nights in Toronto. Wearing 6 layers of clothes didn't help. I felt cold to the bone. I shivered to sleep every night. "What kind of moron pays to voluntarily go through this?", I'd ask.

We were with a slower group, (which was helpful in avoiding altitude sickness). That said, we'd get into camp REALLY LATE. It's one thing hiking up and down when you can see the terrain, during the day. At night, you walk slower, it's colder, and you have to step even more carefully. 8 hour hikes became 10-14 hour treks.

The last night was "interesting". We started our climb at 10pm and while walking in the middle of the night, I started hallucinating (lack of oxygen). First, the rock formation to my right turned into a horse. Then, about an hour later, the rocks on my left morphed into a donkey. The perfect companions to carry me and my bag! I was losing my mind. "Just survive till sunrise" I told myself.

# THE PEAK

By 7am, I was exhausted. I hadn't slept the day before and hadn't eaten in 2 days. So I took a nap at 7am during one of our breaks. When the guides saw me asleep, they jumped me, shook me awake, and yelled at me because at 18,000 feet, a nap could mean a coma. I understood.

But then the sun came out. It started warming up. I woke up. Just keep walking, focusing on just the next step - and then the next - and then the next. Our guides didn't let us ask questions about where the end was. It didn't matter. Only the next step.

Finally the moment arrived - at about 10am, we reached Uhuru. We made it to the top -- and vowed to never do it again. It was a grueling ascent, but now adrenaline was flowing. The sun was shining. You weren't going to stop me from celebrating.

# REFLECTIONS

This had easily been the hardest thing I had ever done (including those sleepless all nighters at the office). It was brutal. But I learned how we protect ourselves. I learned how much more we're capable of. It was really hard in the moment. But the challenge was transient. The high was forever.

Most of all, I learned pole-pole - slowly slowly. The exact opposite of what I'm used to. Not here. The faster you go, the faster you'll fail. Strategy is everything on the mountain.

Now, I've mostly forgotten about the challenges. That vow I took - to never do it again -- it's waning.

# Acknowledgements

[Just Kilimanjaro](http://www.just-kilimanjaro.com) was our guide group - and they were phenomenal. Methley, Noel, and the others really kept us safe, and got us up the mountain.

Dipak and Pravina Mistry - they organized a 21 person family trip to Kilimanjaro. I don't know how they did it, but it was nothing short of magic.

[Sleeping Children Around the World](http://scaw.org) - for running a fantastic organization helping children with bed and school kits all over the world. We raised over $20,000 CDN as part of the campaign and a number of people donated - so thank you to those that donated as well.

Finally - tahnks Asha - so unbelievably glad that I got the chance to do this with you.
