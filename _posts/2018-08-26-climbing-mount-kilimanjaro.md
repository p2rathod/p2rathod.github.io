location: Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, Africa

A slow walk would be too fast for this mountain. One step -- breathe -- another step -- breathe -- a third step, and so on for 7 straight days. That was [our ascent up Mount Kilimanjaro](https://youtu.be/4G02RIr5wmw) - Africa's tallest peak, and the highest free-standing mountain in the world. The trip was a decade in the making. There was only one way up -- "polé-polé" as the guides say -- slowly, slowly.

# SURPRISE! It's a doozy.

Any prep I did, I did last minute (luckily, we had some very solid organizers). Training was next to nothing. I thought I knew enough from the stories I had heard. Besides, reading "too much" would have killed the surprise, right?

The first blunder was the sleeping bag fiasco. Instead of getting a sleeping bag rated at -30 degree celsuis, I ended up with one that could barely survive summer nights in Toronto. Wearing 5 layers of clothes didn't help, nor did the 3 pairs of socks or 2 toques. I felt cold to the bone. I shivered to sleep every night. "What kind of moron pays to voluntarily go through this?", I'd ask. (The answer was inevitably, me).

We were with a slower group, (helpful in avoiding altitude sickness). That said, we'd get into camp REALLY LATE. It's one thing hiking up and down when you can see the terrain, during the day. At night, your walk is slower, the weather is colder, and the risk of injury spikes. 8 hour hikes became 10-14 hour treks.

The last night was "fun". We started our climb at 10pm so we can get to the peak by morning. While walking in the middle of the night, I started hallucinating (lack of sleep and oxygen probably). First, the rock formation to my right turned into a horse. Then, about an hour later, the rocks on my left morphed into a donkey. The perfect companions to carry me and my bag! I was losing my mind. "Just survive till sunrise" I told myself.

# THE PEAK

By 7am, I was exhausted. I hadn't slept the day before and hadn't eaten in 2 days. So I took a nap at 7am during one of our breaks. When the guides saw me asleep, they jumped me, shook me awake, and yelled at me because at 18,000 feet, a nap could turn into something much worse. I understood.

Then the sun came out. It started warming up. I woke up. Just keep walking, focusing on the next step - and then the next - and then the next. Our guides didn't let us ask questions about the end. It didn't matter. Only the next step.

Finally the moment arrived - at about 10am, we reached Uhuru. We made it to the top! Adrenaline was flowing. The sun was shining. You weren't going to stop me from celebrating.

# REFLECTIONS

This had easily been the hardest thing I had ever done (including those sleepless all nighters at the office). It was brutal. But I learned how deeply our minds will go to protect ourselves. I learned how much more we're capable of. I learned about day 1 - where every day is just the beginning. It was really difficult in the moment, but the hardship was transient. The high was forever.

Most of all, I learned "polé-polé" - slowly slowly. The exact opposite of what we're used to. Not here. Not on Mt. Kilimanjaro. Here, the faster you go, the faster you'll fail. Strategy is everything on the mountain.

We made it to the top despite the challenges. The shared experience with Asha, her family, the guides, and the porters is what stays with me.

[Just Kilimanjaro](http://www.just-kilimanjaro.com) was our guide group - and they were phenomenal. Methley, Noel, and the others really kept us safe, and got us up the mountain.

Dipak and Pravina Mistry - they organized a 21 person family trip to Kilimanjaro. I don't know how they did it, but it was nothing short of magic.

[Sleeping Children Around the World](http://scaw.org) - for running a fantastic organization helping children with bed and school kits all over the world. We raised over \$20,000 CDN as part of the campaign and a number of people donated - so thank you to those beautiful souls as well.

Finally - thanks Asha - so unbelievably glad that I got the chance to do this with you.
