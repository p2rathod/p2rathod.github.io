## Prelude

This post is about pecans. Yes, pecans. Specifically the business of pecans. Guess what: I outsourced the research (yes, outsourced).

I wanted to test upwork.com (an outsourcing tool) again, this time to do online research. If you know me, you know I've spent thousands of dollars on upwork and every penny has been well spent. This time, I spent < $10 asking someone to answer a series of questions about the business of pecans.

Why pecans? A book I read in January called [Braiding Sweetgrass](https://www.amazon.com/Braiding-Sweetgrass-Indigenous-Scientific-Knowledge-ebook/dp/B00D0V44LC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488646824&sr=8-1&keywords=braiding+sweetgrass) spoke to the overlap of Native American folklore and botanic theory (in general, the book lacks focus IMO). In it, Robin Wall Kimmerrer mention how pecans are harvested. I began to wonder why pecans, of all nuts, were so incredibly expensive.

Well, here's why:

## The Business of Pecans

The pecan harvest year to year is unpredictable. In a nutshell, each stakeholder prices in that risk (get it?!).

Let me start at the beginning.

Over 93% of the world's pecans are exported from the USA and Mexico. The rest come from South Africa, Australia, Israel, Brazil, and Peru. Over 108 metric tonnes of pecans were grown globally in 2015, a 59% increase over the past decade.

Pecans need 205-233 frost-free days (which is why you won't see pecan trees in Toronto any time soon). They ripen once a year sometime between October and January. Pecan trees also alternate between bearing a heavy crop and a light crop, year to year. Lastly, they're incredibly fragile, impacted by the quality of soil, amount of water, quality of pollination, and overcrowding.

In another words - pecan trees are high-maintenance and have become more attractive over the past decade.

### Why have pecans become so popular?

Blame the pecan's eerily similar taste to the hickory nut (which is insanely popular in South East Asia). The similarity has caused countries in this region to go bonkers over pecans.
Vietnam grew it's pecan imports by 170% and Hong Kong remains the US's largest export partner of in-shelled pecans.

In Europe, The Netherlands bought 19% more pecans (though also sold a lot of them), and the UK increased their consumption by 12% from 2013 to 2014. Those growth trends continue their patterns globally into 2016 and now 2017 due to the many health benefits that pecans provide.

### In summary:

* Harvesting and forecasting of pecans is difficult. It's high maintenance and risk is priced in.
* Asia's demand for hickory nuts and similarity with pecans
* Global growth of pecans as a healthy alternative

The pecans I eat are generally from the US (probably Georgia). They cost above $10 in Toronto's stores, but the unit import price is < $5 (so here's where I question the markup).

Hope you've learned a bit more about pecans. If you're ever interested in talking about anything "outsourced", happy to talk more.


p.s. if you're looking for an epic pecan milk shake, head to [Jawny Baker's](http://www.jawnybakers.com/) - their chocolate pecan shake is insane.
