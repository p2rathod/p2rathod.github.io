The product management field is relatively new. It’s so new, that there aren’t really any university programs to learn about it. When you say product manager, 9 out of 10 people don’t know what the hell you actually do. I think as a career path, we’re still trying to figure it out and that’s pretty damn exciting.

It’s important for us to understand the roots of product management so we can help define it, shape it, and honor it. Martin Erikkson wrote a great [blog post](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2015/10/history-evolution-product-management/) on the history of PM in 2015. In it, he cites a [memo](http://3lsqjy1sj7i027fcn749gutj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McElroyBrandMan.pdf) written by Neil H. McElroy as the birth of modern product management.

That memo outlined a description of “Brand Men” and their absolute responsibility for brand success. It includes responsibilities ranging from tracking sales to managing the product, advertising and promotions. He describes that the best way to do this was through thorough field testing and client interaction.

HP interpreted the Brand Man ethos as putting decision making as close as possible to the customer. They spoke about the product manager owning the voice of the customer. In the seminal book [The HP Way](https://www.amazon.com/HP-Way-Hewlett-Business-Essentials-ebook/dp/B00F2I2H7Y/ref=sr_1_1) this policy is credited with sustaining Hewlett-Packard’s 50 year record of unbroken 20% year-on-year growth between 1943 and 1993.

In post-war Japan, Toyota created the Toyota Production System and just-in-time manufacturing. They focused on two key concepts: Kaizen and Genchi Genbutsu. They are, continuous improvement through the elimination of waste and the ability to go to the source to find facts and make correct decisions. That process was embraced by HP and adopted globally.

The blog post can be found [here](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2015/10/history-evolution-product-management/) and the [memo](http://3lsqjy1sj7i027fcn749gutj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McElroyBrandMan.pdf) here. Both are good reads.
