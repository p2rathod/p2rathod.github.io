Personas are great. They're incredibly important in making the right product decisions over time.

When done right, here's what happens:
* Entire product strategies shift to solve 'acute' user problems.
* Engineers make customer-centric decisions when making code and architecture decisions.
* Customer success teams help solve a customer's deeper needs.
* There is unity among the account, customer success, engineering, and product teams. It means that the organization is more likely to move forward together in lockstep. It leads to a concept I like to call 'organizational flow.'

The problem is, Persona Development is hard and rarely done right. Teams build personas as an offer of lip service to being customer-centric. It's an afterthought for too many product teams. Ultimately, the takeaway is that the person is 'busy.' Personas are rarely insightful, relevant, and functional. And it drives me nuts.

In August 2019, I walked into a startup's office saw one of the most beautiful looking persona posters I'd ever seen. It depicted a mother who was also an executive. It provided a timeline of her day. She was busy. Here's the problem: the poster was hidden in a small meeting room, for no one to see. It didn't tell me what acute problem existed and why it was relevant to the business. It didn't tell me why this person would hire the startup and pay for it. It didn't tell me how she was solving the problem today. It didn't inform the Kano model. It was a beautiful poster, and provided a shallow overview of the problem that this startup was attacking. And that's why it was tucked away in a small meeting room.

The best product teams build products for people. It doesn't matter if you're a B2B or B2C organization. If you're not walking in your customer's shoes, then you're not maximizing the opportunity for yourself.

Here's how I work through personas:
1. Learn about the customer. Ask generic questions and find a baseline. Take lots of notes. Interview 5-10 users.
2. Break down the notes and begin to understand their needs in first principles. Use the 5 why's and read between the lines.
3. Build a context around the persona. What elements in the life of the persona leads him/her to the decisions they make?
4. Build the Kano Model for your persona. What is the hierarchy of needs for this person?
5. Make her human. Build a story around your persona and give her a name.
6. Teach and refine. Take notes, make it look great and spread it around the organization, especially with your customer support and success teams. Let them question your assumptions and help them be part of the process.

I guarantee your team's mindset will shift if you work through this exercise.

Note: Though I generally share examples, I won't here. When done right, it's IP for a business. It's relevant to a specific industry, so an sample won't generically be helpful. That's part of the reason that so many of the examples online are bogus.

Great personas help product teams make better decisions. And ultimately, the teams that make better decisions are the teams that win.

Here are the sections I generally include in any persona:
* Photo and name (make sure theyâ€™re either fake your you have permission to use them)
* Overview (give us her story)
* Technologies she uses
* Daily activities
* Her goals
* Her biggest challenges (should be relevant to your business)
* How she's solving the challenge today
* Kano Model
