> Because at the end, you think about the beginning

We were at Williams Cafe in Waterloo, at University Plaza.

It was early 2008 and I was meeting Kunal for the first time. He was working with a team on a really novel idea - putting magazines and newspapers on mobile. Remember, this was a time when the iPhone and Android barely existed - when BlackBerry was still king. Then I met the rest of the crew -- Michael, Gaurav, Rahul, and Carlo. I felt like I had joined today’s equivalent of the Golden State Warriors -- this was a super-team.

### An upstart startup

We didn’t take a break for about 3 years. There were times that we slept at the office. We wore winter jackets in the summer and shorts in the winter - the temperature control continues to be brutal. There were ikea desks in our hallway - we were busting at the seams.

At the time we had worked with some of the most prestigious news brands in the world. We were educating them on what mobile apps were. We worked with the Time Magazine, CNNMoney, Sports Illustrated, TalkSport, The Globe And Mail, and The Toronto Maple Leafs just to name a few. We had built their iOS, Android, and BlackBerry apps.

Kunal was our Sales lead, Carlo and Michael ran our servers, Rahul and I built the mobile app pipeline. We had a lot of help. Jason, Marlon, Jon, Sydney, Jen, Andrew, Darrin, Andy, Roberto, Rafat, Gaurav, and about 100 more. Everyone did everything. That’s how we scaled. We rebuilt the platform at least 3 times. As the market moved, so did we.

I remember thinking that we’d exit in a few years. I worked with Polar as a late co-founder, right out of school like the rest of the team. It was a no-brainer taking that risk. It was thrilling working on the mission. It was really cool taking the train every morning and seeing strangers use the apps that we made.

### Adult Supervision

We had a lot of issues. Software would break. Sometimes (most times) it would ship late -- I mean really late -- and customers yelled at us like we were kids (which, we were). Truly, we didn’t know our heads from our asses.

We brought in Jason Stanley as our VP of Operations. I wasn’t a fan of hiring anybody. I thought we could do it on our own, which was pretty naive. I remember his first week at Polar. I was pulling all nighters working on the Time Magazine iOS app and he was living out of the hotel down the street. Jason sat at the office with me every night that week. He didn’t have to. He showed me that he was in the trenches with me. In that moment, I learned what leadership was.

Then we brought in Andrew Shannon as our CFO. I was shocked that a small shop like Polar was able to land a guy like Andrew. He had just ushered a company through a huge exit. He came in, sat at a desk in the hallway, and went to work. He’s humble, but the guy is an absolute assassin. He showed us to get out of the way - and then we raised \$6M from Georgian Partners. Andrew is why we’re still in business. We are lucky to have him.

An observation about Justin and Simon at Georgian, who are also why we’re still in business: they’re open, trusting, and able to connect strategy with execution better than anyone else I’ve met. At a distance, I’ve learned what it means to be smart, aggressive, and humble all at the same time. I still remember the stories they’d tell us from their days at DWL. I loved hearing about that culture.

### Learning to Execute

As we evolved the platform, we built MediaEverywhere - a content distribution platform that spanned mobile and tablet, web, and apps. We were ambitious - we tried to rebuild the mobile Internet experience. We brought in even more help (Nino, Shane, Tony, Mark, and others). We even brought on a few more executives to help us:

Rahul N. - I learned what it means to be an organizational leader. Your biggest impact has been on our culture, which we’re still benefiting from. I appreciate your friendship and mentorship.
JP - When I interviewed you, I touted Kanban as the process we used in Engineering. I had read an in-depth blog article about it, and thought I knew everything that I needed to know. Then you read 3 books over the weekend, and schooled me during our second interview. That’s when I knew that you were our guy. Thanks for investing in your team, our Engineering process, and building a system of excellence.
Sean - Simply, you know how to run a sales organization. You spoke about funnel math when we were more interested in sales relationships. You helped professionalize our go to market efforts. Thanks for helping me learn about that part of the business.

With a new team, we were ready to get into market. We had some success on a new platform, but more issues and bugs arose. It was hard back then, pushing the limits of the mobile web browser.

Then our customer’s starting taking their mobile web and app business in-house. It was too important to them. They needed more control. Polar’s mobile business was plateauing.

At the time, I ran our mobile monetization strategy and one of our product lines was a ‘native ads’ offering. We worked it into a feature on the platform. Then we learned more, and saw an opportunity, so we hacked it into a standalone platform. We tested it and the results were strong. Really strong.

After raising \$6m and hiring 3 new execs, we pivoted the entire organization. That decision took guts. We went from building apps to becoming a native advertising company. That was hard, but I think we supported the team, worked transparently, did things the right way. The team (from execs to gtm to product and engineering) helped us execute the pivot to perfection. We were lucky that the market timing was right.

### Innovation Is Habitual

The branded content business started to grow really quickly. We were building a massive global presence. Our platform, MediaVoice, was built on strong foundations and leveraged tech from the previous platform.

We had partners in over a dozen countries and opened offices in Toronto, New York, London, and Sydney. Our biggest partnerships continued to grow. Our relationships with customers (Lindsay, Jeff, Spencer, Gareth, Chris, Meredith, Nathalie, and more) were flourishing. We were hitting every one of our quarterly goals. We had the right product strategy and execution. Things were rolling.

We earned our partners’ trust with service. Branded content as a revenue source has scaled for publishers - in part due to the platform we’ve built and the services we’ve offered. I’m proud that we’ve always been publisher first and continued to innovate with them.

Not all risks worked out for us. One of our experiments was a platform that helped increase yield from 3rd party ad networks. We reverse engineered that part of the market -- the platform utilized strategies that could increase revenue for publishers by 30 to 200%. During our beta, we realized that we inadvertently started working with some of the shadier participants of the web (sites with a tonne of bot traffic). It wasn’t where we wanted to be. It wasn’t the trusted web. We sunset the platform because of that. Operationally, it was a decision that hurt us for a long time. Tom, Adam, Mack - wrong place, wrong time, but I’m happy that we had the opportunity to work together. This was a risk that didn’t work for us.

Luckily we had the branded content business, which continued to grow and continued to support the worlds biggest publishers. So we doubled our efforts there. Despite market volatility, our partners continued to grow their business.

Old habits die hard, it seems. Whether it’s mobile apps or advertising, we are reluctant to accept something that’s broken. Today Polar offers monetization solutions for every part of a publisher’s business. Our platform is multi-tenant, white-labeled, and has end-to-end capabilities to run a branded content business. Sometimes we work with 7-9 different groups within the same publishing organization, which calls attention to the foundations of the platform.

The future looks really bright.

### A Personal Reset

Polar’s success thus far gives me the permission to step back and reset. I’m taking 6mo to travel, as I look to experience new cultures with my wife. I’m really excited. I don’t yet know where we’re going or what we’re doing, but someone said that “life begins at the end of your comfort zone” - so here goes.

### Gratitude

On any given day we get to speak with team members and customers on 4 different continents. You’d think that we’d have to work around the clock, but Polar stands for an environment where people “work to live”. Our team members have traveled the globe, built relationships, grown their families, and worked through crippling injuries. Polar has always supported the team and community. The organization has been unwavering in this regard.

Today, our Product and Engineering teams continue to rethink how we build. My favourite solutions are always the ones that start off as ideas from an internal hackathon. I love when Engineering shows the organization what’s possible. I love how they’re able to take an idea - a hack - and operationalize it, creating value for an entire industry. They’ve built a platform that we leverage, over and over again. Most of the team has a tenure of 5-10 years -- impressive.

Our marketing team is really tight knit and their execution is spot-on. I love how much data they use when building lists, creating campaigns, or measuring content engagement. I love that they’re grounded in creating content that’s actually valuable for publishers. I love that they’re not afraid to think differently, to punch above their weight.

Our sales & accounts teams are truly in the trenches with our customers. They’ve built personal relationships from professional introductions showing a human touch that I hadn’t seen before. I love how they provide strategic value regardless of how the tech is used. They’re experts.

The TAMs have the uncanny ability to traverse the world of relationships and technical implementation. They solve problems showing me that you can be an account owner, a technical implementer, and a strategic partner all at the same time. They set the bar high. Sometimes I wonder if there is anything that these guys can’t do.

Our HR and Finance group help us focus. They run operations for 4 different offices and have to deal with tax and HR laws globally. I love that they do this for so many other companies in the Toronto tech space too. Everything runs so smoothly -- you’d think that even once, there’d be some sort of human error. They must be robots. But then I interact with them and well -- who knew accountants were so much fun?! Thanks for running the business so that the rest of us can experiment.

I’m proud of helping build a robust technology business in Toronto. I’m proud of doing it for over a decade. Most of all, I’m proud of getting to work with a great team at every stage.

Thank you for an incredibly fun journey. I’m grateful.

Cheers,
Pratik

### To Our Team Today (in no specific order):

- Greg - I love how easily you’re able to simplify a message and tell a story. It seems effortless. Finn is a monster. History.On.This.Day is my favourite instagram account.
- Lori - You’re the most hip mother I’ve ever met (and the most hip person at Polar -- not sure if that’s a reflection on you or the team -- maybe a bit of both). The way you impart values of civic duty on your kids is inspiring. How you handle our entire US business and stay sane, I’ll never know.
- Gavin - You seem to have figured it all out. Family, multiple businesses, living on a beach. One of these days, we’re grabbing a beer so I can learn that secret.
- Kreg - man, Polar’s culture would be nowhere without you. You deserve the best. When we butted heads, it made us closer. Thanks for taking that step. Jack is the epitome of chill.
- KJ - I really admire how you’re able to build relationships and it’s beginning to translate to partners as well. Whether its exercise, painting, working at a bar, or singing, you’re always in 110%. “So extra”.
- Ryan - Your encyclopedic knowledge of useless is uncanny. I love that you’ve taken the leap to live in London and New York all the while building deep relationships. You showed me how to traverse the professional and personal divide. I’m going to miss the green suit.
- Scott - Smart, and humble. I love that you openly share the love-hate relationship surrounding your cat and dog. More photos please.
- Sadad - ENERGY. I wish I could bottle it and keep it in my back pocket. I’m going to miss the “Sadad…..from down under” updates and mostly our conversations about our history, lives, and families. Looking forward to seeing you in Sydney at some point.
- Stephen - I’m going to miss our conversations about planes, piloting, and cycling. I love that you’ve taken a physically taxing hobby (cycling for days) and made it into a charity event. I hope to join you next year when I’m in town.
- Matt - how we got two aviation fanatics as our QA team is beyond me. I’m going to miss talking about running, and aviation. I loved when we worked together on MediaConductor and when I got to see your family grow. Thanks for making this office eco-friendly.
- Jacqueline - I miss the pop you brought to the office. You took the bull by the horns in a male dominated industry and showed us who’s boss. I’m humbled by how great a mother you’ve already been.
- Chris - You’re a mentor. You define the bar for shipping with quality. You have the patience to do the right thing versus the quick thing. I’m going to miss your comedy at the lunch table and your many, many lightning talks. I learned a tonne.
- Daniel - My favourite time was when we worked together on the Forbes / Collections project. You dig into problems from a user perspective just as easily as covering technical challenges. You’ve touched every part of the platform and have always built to create leverage. I admire that. (p.s. you’re smarter than your brother)
- Ed - I really respect your thirst for life. You’re curious and willing to create experiences in ways most people don’t even think about. I’m going to miss that infectious laugh.
- James - I love that even as a new hire, you managed to turn an entire team into your IDE of choice. You’ve already made your mark on Polar and the Engineering team. You’re enterprising and always working on bleeding edge tech. I am glad I got to see you start your life with Tara here in Toronto.
- Eric - You’re easily the ‘most interesting man at Polar’. I love hearing about your adventures, be it cycling, running, sailing, or more. You travel for experience and I hope to embody some of those lessons over the next few months.
- David - I love how you throw yourself into a problem and learn the skills you need to get it done, be it benchmarks, insights, or slack stats. You continue to make Polar better culturally and through data. I’m going to miss your perspective on government and your investment in the team.
- Sergei - I’m really going to miss your passion, your demeanor, and hearing about your many extra-curricular activities (plants, aquarium, wood working, house building, traveling, knife throwing…god, who knows what else?). I respect what you’ve done for Polar, ensuring a robust infrastructure for the world’s biggest publishers. I’m going to miss you. Congratulations on growing your family - you’re a great role model for your son and daughter.
- Relaida and Thomas - Thank you for helping us run the business so smoothly. I’m going to miss the charm Relaida brings and the energy Thomas has. I think the cactus thing is still hilarious.
- Andrew - Thanks for being here for us, for me, for so long. My favourite time was the early years, seeing you show us how to run a real business. I enjoyed kicking your ass at table tennis ;)
- And obviously Kunal, Rahul, Michael, Carlo -- I've told you directly what needs to be said. Thank you.

If you thought that this was too many words, then have Chris or Michael show you some of my JIRA tickets from 2013. I’m making up for it now.

Thanks for such an incredibly fun time. I trust that I’ll see you all soon (maybe in a new office).

Cheers,
Pratik
