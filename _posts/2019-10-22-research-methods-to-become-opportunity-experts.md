description: Becoming the opportunity expert is a key step in owning the success and value of the problem you're trying to solve.

I think that product owners are often misrepresented. We are labelled as the people who figure it out, who understand the product - the solution - better than anyone else. That’s true - it is our responsibility to know more.

But before any of that begins, I like relabeling the product manager role to “opportunity expert”. As product owners, we must know more about the market, customer, and company. We must know more about the problem and the opportunity. As product owners, learning how to learn is as important as creating solutions.

This is an important post. I’m a builder - I love playing with the lego pieces of customer behaviour and new technology. But when you’re tasked with creating value, working backwards from the opportunity is how you get to the right solution. It’s called evidence-based product ownership.

I was asked recently how I approached understanding opportunities, especially when you’re exploring new features or adjacent opportunities. Here's how I've codified it:

### Key Questions

I observe my research methodology into three buckets, trying to answer the following:

**Market**  
What is the size of the opportunity? This takes into account the size of your addressable market, economic climate, as well as the competitive landscape.

**Ethnographic**  
Who are the customers and what are their needs? What do their days look like? Do users truly care about the problem? What do different types of users look like? Describe the people, their histories, and mutual differences.

**Facing The Brutal Facts**  
Do we have the right assets (customers, data, people) to solve the problem scope?

### Stages In Your Evolution

There are three stages of product research. In each, you may want to flex one category more than another. For example:

**How this differs from 0 - 1**  
The quantitative data is important, but you don’t have a lot of primary data to hang your hat on. I rely heavily on stats I can find, speaking with as many people as possible, running interviews, and sometimes sending out surveys. I focus even more heavily on ethnographic research, given that you haven't formed a company yet.

**Building adjacent solutions**  
During this phase, you’ll want to have a pretty even balance across the market, ethnographic, and company research. This is a massive benefit. The asset you have over the previous phase is primary data. Your data provides an unfair advantage over new businesses.

**How this differs from 1-many growth**  
When you’re looking to understand how to better grow, you may pay less attention to the market size (having already done that homework) and will be quantitatively driven. That means you’ll have access to primary data sources, which you’ll have to pull and instrument into dashboards. You’ll want to continue to level-set and face the brutal facts.

I try to become an expert in each of these industries before I invest. That’s not always how it plays out, but its always the goal.

Ok, let's get to it.

## Market Research

There are three methods in which I get a better understanding of market information.

- **News**  
  News sources indicate the cultural narrative currently and going forward. Journalists have great insight into the societal conversation. They also give me an understanding of the economic climate and the competitive landscape. I value the news a lot.
- **Data**
  - Addressable Market: Once I have a better idea of what types of data I’m looking for, I get into it. I try to find population data, trends over the last 5-10 years.
  - Economic Trends: Understand how much is spent in the market, and how specifically it is spent. Understand how these trends over time.
  - Competitive Landscape: Look up data on the alternatives (sites like crunchbase.com, owler.com, and company blogs are great). I try to do a full lean canvas and strategy canvas for each of the alternative solutions.
- **Interviews**  
  There is no better way to gain market insights than to interview people who have participated in the said market. You’ll learn from their mistakes, and gain insights that they’ve already learned. I try to speak with at least 3 people who have tried or have entered the same market in non-competitive categories.

By the end of this market research, you’ll have pages of stats and notes. I always try to summarize the insights into a single, internal slide, allowing me to have a high-level understanding as well as a better understanding of the details.

## Ethnographic Research

My goal here is to create personas based on the research I take part in. I’m a big fan of creating personas that are true, clear, and relevant. They provide a sense of empathy, an understanding of attitudinal and behavioural habits that only shine through when you speak with individuals.

Be careful - I’ve seen many personas that give me a great understanding of my user group, but provide no insight on the depth of their needs as it relates to the problem I’m solving. The need has to be explicit. We can’t assume that everyone will know what you implicitly understand.

I take on ethnographic research by:

- **Data and public stats**  
  Get a better idea of what the trends are in the particular user group I’m attacking. I try to brainstorm the secondary and tertiary impact of trends, to see if the problem I’m solving will become bigger, stay the same, or become smaller.
- **Surveys**  
  Surveys give me a good way to get high-level information across many people, but I found interviews and observation to be a far better method of understanding an individual and culture.
- **Observation**  
  If you’re able to, shadow people in your customer base. Take them out for lunch or coffee and just see what their world looks like. Have a deep understanding of what their struggles are and what they happen to go through. Use the tools that they use in a test environment. If you can get to a point where you could do their job for them, for even a day, then you’ve observed well. This is why most founders start companies in a vertical that they’re familiar with - that they’ve already worked in. See if you can get those same insights in a fraction of the time.
- **Interviews**  
  Interviews are a great way to go deep, get insights, and do it within 30 to 45 minutes. I use this methodology a lot, especially early on, and especially when proximity is an issue. I play the numbers game, like outside-sales reps and try to call as many users as possible. I like to get 3-10 users to give me good feedback. Once you get to a point where 80% of the feedback is repeated, then you can pause.

Most PMs I meet will sit behind their desks. They’ll use [scalable methods](https://community.uservoice.com/blog/scalable-user-research-methods/) fo research — which is important. But they lose sight of speaking with individuals, getting a deep qualitative understanding of their attitudes and behaviours. In my experience, this has been a key part of creating solutions that individuals love.

## Facing The Brutal Facts - The Company

The last step in this research is answering why us? Most people (myself included) don’t do this well. We don’t often face brutal facts and are rarely completely honest with ourselves.

Here’s how I look inward:

- **Customer segments** by revenue, size, type - try to get a better understanding rooted in the quantitative evidence of my current customers if any.
- **Customer information** through email, Slack, and Salesforce - understand the trends and narratives as it relates to various customer segments.
- **Strengths and weaknesses** help you level set. They'll help you leverage your strengths and fill roles to alleviate your weaknesses.
- **Blue Ocean Canvas**: (read [Blue Ocean Strategy](https://www.amazon.ca/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Expanded-Uncontested/dp/1625274491/)) - what is our blue ocean and is the new opportunity aligned in entrenching our values?
- **Identify our flywheel**: (read [Good To Great](https://www.amazon.ca/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/0066620996/)) - identify your flywheel and align your actions accordingly.

When you've done the research, you become the expert as early as possible. That helps you make better decisions. It helps you make the case with your team and executives. Ultimately it helps you shape better products for the customers you serve.
