After traveling for [8 months with the wifey](/system/2019/02/27/5-takeways-from-quitting-and-taking-time-off.html), I decided to take a few months to work on products and projects that were top of mind, but that I didn't have time to pursue.

The first project I worked on was "Rafiki" - a personal lifestyle concierge. As more of our lives surface online, management of appointments, bookings, and organizing service providers becomes a hassle. Planning family activities and dates become harder also. There is too much optionality - and 'researching' online takes forever.

I have a personal assistant on contract to do any online research for me. It saves me a tonne of time. It's how I found a wedding venue, how I gather industry research, and how I've found good AirBnB's to stay at while traveling. I often find myself going down the rabbit hole while doing any time of research online. Having an assistant on contract saves me from that.

So I wanted this for everyone. While I knew how to work with Fiverr and Upwork, most of my friends never took to it. So I decided to make this accessible. I decided to build a virtual concierge service of my own.

### Launching:

I launched with about a dozen active users as a free service - mostly friends and family. Actually, all friends and family. The "AskJeeves" jokes were endless. Good times.

I launched with a chatbot (more on that later). I either outsourced tasks, or did them myself.

Some examples of tasks we completed: finding service providers like mechanics, products like baby seats, and planning date nights. It became an interesting way to figure out what people needed help with, and how we could better help.

The plan was to automate and operationalize the common tasks over time, but still offer personalized, white-glove service. I wanted to scale great customer service and account management, for consumers.

This is hard to do. Labour, even overseas, became too expensive to turn a profit on every single task. At (as low as) \$15/hr, a task that might take anyone - even the best - up to 1-2 hours to do, would be too expensive for someone in my market to pay for.

Other opportunities for value creation were tested. Could we package our work and then either re-sell it, or publish it? It's possible, but I didn't pursue this hard enough.

For example, as an ad business, a $0.50 CPM x 2 ads per page will give you $1 per thousand page views. You'd need 100,000 pageviews per month to make a \$100 bucks. If you could figure out a niche, branding, and distribution in this climate, it could be done - but it would be really hard.

I concluded the following:

- The individuals I was testing with (middle class young professionals) weren't willing to pay about $10-$20 for someone to execute online research for them, on an on-going basis.
- Some (specifically baby boomers) had concerns around privacy - especially when managing and coordinating appointments.

I still think there's an opportunity here. I built something for wide appeal, which hasn't worked. There is a market where this could work, IMO. I haven't found it yet, nor does it seem, others have either.

### Options:

Along the way, I came across and tested a number of similar solutions. I didn't find any that were turning a profit as a business - though, it seems, that's rarely the goal nowadays. Here is my quick review of each:

- FancyHands: This was the best service I worked with. Real people, in North America executed tasks and communicated in a timely fashion. The model was fairly affordable. The UX wasn't great, but the work was of decent quality. They've primarily pivoted to offering a B2B offering.
- Magic: The interface was nice - an AI based chatbot. Really easy to use. The service however was incredibly expensive - upwards of \$1 per minute.
- Fin: They ended up pivoting as an organization away from personal assistance (for many of the same reasons that I came across). You can see their post [here](https://www.fin.com/posts/fins-plan-for-2019/).
- OkRelax: Overseas assistants execute your tasks. I found that responses were incredibly slow, and the interface was confusing.

Ultimately I chose to shut Rafiki down because I couldn't see a clear path to profitability - the unit economics didn't work well. Even gross margins were in the red. I found myself playing with the numbers for days, creating multiple models. I found myself forcing the a square peg in a round hole. The only way I could get this to work, was to focus on B2B - which many of the aforementioned platforms were pivoting to.

For me, this wasn't where I wanted to focus, just yet. I've since shut down Rafiki, but have learned a tonne. If you're interested in the product, check out [Building Rafiki](/products/2019/03/04/building-rafiki.html)
