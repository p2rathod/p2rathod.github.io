After traveling for [8 months with the wifey](/system/2019/02/27/5-takeways-from-quitting-and-taking-time-off.html), I decided to take a time to work on several products and projects that had been top of mind.

The first in the series of projects was called "Rafiki" - a personal lifestyle concierge. As more of our lives become digital, management of appointments, bookings, and services becomes a hassle. Planning activities for the family becomes harder. I find that there's too much optionality. For me, researching for the 'best' takes too long.

I've outsourced research work before. It saves me a tonne of time. It's how I found a wedding venue, how I gather industry research, and how I've found good AirBnB's to stay at while traveling. Having an assistant on contract saves me from spending too much time online, but helps me learn really quickly.

So I wanted this for everyone. While I've been working with contractors on Upwork for years, most of my friends never took to it. So I decided to make this far more accessible. I decided to build a virtual concierge service of my own, available through a messaging interface.

### Launching:

I launched with about a dozen active users as a free service - mostly friends and family. Actually, all friends and family. The "AskJeeves" jokes were endless. Good times.

I launched with a chatbot (more on that later). I either outsourced tasks, or did them myself.

Some examples of tasks we completed: finding service providers like mechanics, products like baby seats, and planning date nights. It became an interesting way to figure out what people needed help with, and how we could better help.

The plan was to automate and operationalize the common tasks over time, but still offer personalized, white-glove service. I wanted to scale great customer service and account management, for consumers.

This is hard to do. Labour, even overseas, became too expensive to turn a profit on every single task. At (as low as) \$15/hr, a task that might take anyone - even the best - up to 1-2 hours to do, could be too expensive for most in the middle-class. I had built access from a UX perspective, but not an economic one.

Other opportunities for value creation were tested. We tested a [Shopify](https://shopify.com) store and packaged a few pieces of research as digital items. We bought ads on [Facebook](https://facebook.com) and [Bing](https://bing.com). No one bit. We even tested publishing the content for free, and turning it into an ad business. But again, the economics never worked. For example, at a $0.50 CPM x 2 ads per page will give you $1 per thousand page views. You'd need 100,000 pageviews per month to make a \$100. If you could figure out a niche, branding, and distribution in this climate, it could be done - but it would be really hard.

I concluded the following:

- The individuals I was testing with (middle class young professionals) weren't willing to pay about $10-$20 for someone to execute online research for them, on an on-going basis.
- Some (specifically baby boomers) had concerns around privacy - especially when managing and coordinating appointments.

I still think there's an opportunity here. I built something for wide appeal, which hasn't worked. There is a market where this could work, IMO. I haven't found it yet, nor does it seem, others have either.

### Alternatives:

Along the way, I came across and tested a number of similar solutions. I didn't find any that were turning a profit as a consumer business - though, it seems, that's rarely the goal nowadays. Here is my quick review of each:

- [FancyHands](https://www.fancyhands.com/): This was the best service I worked with. The contractors were all in North America and they executed tasks and communicated in a timely fashion. The model was fairly affordable. The UX wasn't great. They've primarily pivoted to offering a B2B offering though.
- [Magic](https://getmagic.com/): The interface was nice - an AI based chatbot. Really easy to use. The service however was incredibly expensive - upwards of \$1 per minute CAD.
- [Fin](https://www.fin.com/): They ended up pivoting as an organization away from personal assistance (for many of the same reasons that I came across). You can see their post [here](https://www.fin.com/posts/fins-plan-for-2019/).
- [OkayRelax](https://okayrelax.com/): Overseas assistants execute your tasks. I found that responses were incredibly slow, and the interface was confusing.

### B2B

I started looking at businesses, selling into into it as benefits. The amount of time professionals spend at work coordinating personal errands was shocking. Over a course of a year, an entire month is lost to personal tasks. There's a massive opportunity here and some are starting to explore this.

Ultimately I chose to shut Rafiki down because I couldn't see a clear path to profitability - the unit economics didn't work well. Gross margins were poor. I found myself playing with the numbers for days, creating multiple models. I found myself forcing a square peg in a round hole.

For me, this wasn't where I wanted to focus, just yet. I've since shut down Rafiki, but have learned a tonne. If you're interested in the product, check out [Building Rafiki](/build/2019/03/04/building-rafiki.html).
