We believe the market is desperate for a measure that’s common across all native ad content. A measure can be applied across the board, and one that can be used to benchmark against. The metrics that meet these needs, that drive actionable insights, and that measure an advertisers ability to engage their audience starts and ends in social.

But social is such a generic term. What does it mean and how is it measured? Today's de-facto metric, “social actions”, values the share, the like, and the comment equally. This is similar to comparing nickels to quarters, because after all, they're still all just coins. Clearly the share, the like, and the comment have varying levels of value [1]. Let's start with that as the baseline.

### The Metrics:

Metrics like impressions, pageviews shares, and likes are classified as vanity metrics [2]; There is little ability to compare and contrast when these are the only metrics one reports on. As an example, a niche content program such as a LexisNexis campaign will never reach the volume of page views that a national coca cola campaign would – and volume metrics like shares and likes do not provide a fair comparison. In the display world, we look at CTR. With click-through-rate, we can begin to tell a story around the performance of a display ad and compare various campaigns on a level playing field. Like CTR for display, there must be an equivalent, ratio–based metric in social.

Two distinct metrics surface as we consider social performance: Yield and Interaction Rate.

#### Yield:

Yield provides a measure of how successful a social network is by comparing referral traffic to the total number of shares (per network). For example, if 100 people shared a story on both network A and network B, but referral traffic from each was 150 and 300 respectively, clearly network B was the more ’successful’ one. Referral traffic via paid amplification should be ignored in these calculations, but this metric does provides a great indicator of where to invest in for greater reach.

#### Interaction Rate:

Interaction rate provides a measure around the engagement and virality of content. It is measured by dividing the number of actions by the number of total page views (telling us how many page views resulted in a social action). This is the measure that allows us to benchmark against. This is the 'native ad CTR'. A breakdown of interaction rate by social network tells me which of my audience was most engaged (engaged enough to take action is really what matters today).

### Final Remarks:

It's these two metrics, yield and interaction rate, that will be is the currency of content. As an advertiser, I need to measure how engaged my audience is and how to reach more of them. A solutions provider needs to drive ways to collect, analyze, and action on these metrics. Try using yield and interaction rate as a reference for content quality.
