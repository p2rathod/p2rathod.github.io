How do you move from problem to opportunity, and from opportunity to solution within a product organization? How do you make the process efficient, transparent, and repeatable? How do you build the right product, at the right time, for the right audience?

We wanted a process that forced deep thought, but was easy to use and maintain. We wanted to force objectivity and data-collection. We wanted a tool that housed product information and that served as a clear communication tool. At Polar, we created a tool that met our needs: _The Product Canvas_.

### The Product Canvas

_The Product Canvas_ is a fast and easy way to communicate product iterations, features, and solutions. It is inspired by Ash Maurya’s work on Lean Canvas. However, where the Lean Canvas helps a startup think through its business model, the Product Canvas helps them think about their existing product and its challenges. It creates a repeatable process around problem solving, and serves as a communication tool between product management, engineering, marketing, and beyond.

The three areas of the _Product Canvas_ are:

- **Persona, Problem, and Goals:** Here, product managers identify the issue, who it’s affecting, end goals and criteria for success. It deliberately keeps this top of mind.
- **Solution(s):** Product managers will look at existing solutions and begin to formulate their own. They will also think through execution, partnerships, and resources if necessary.
- **External/Product Mktg:** Here, product managers will collect customer feedback and validate the solution. They will think through adoption – both execution and who will adopt the solution first.

At Polar, the Product Canvas has become the launchpad for product updates and new features. Below is a depiction with descriptions and use cases.

### The benefits

We’ve seen 3 major benefits to using this tool:

- **Actionable:** The ‘Examples’ box forces us to look at industry examples. It acknowledges existing best-in-class solutions. The validation box motivates a product team to bring customers into the fold - to test and validate. Actions on these fronts are core to solving the puzzle.
- **Think broadly, think deeply:** The canvas provides areas of input, all the way from problem and persona, to adoption and documentation. This allows us to complete the thought around product upfront and preemptively.
- **Learn, don’t pitch:** The canvas keeps persona, problem, goals, and success criteria top of mind. It forces customer validation and research of industry norms. The solution box is deliberately placed in the middle so that it can encompass the information surrounding it. In other words, data drives the solution.

There are clear similarities between this and the Lean Canvas. Yes, we’ve sampled it, and yes it worked. I'd love to hear your feedback. I'd love to hear about where this can be improved. I hope it helps you build better products, just like it has for us.

Cheers,
Pratik
