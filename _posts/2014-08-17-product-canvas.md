How do you move from problem, to opportunity, to solution within a product organization? How do you make the process efficient, transparent, and repeatable? How do you build the right product, at the right time, for the right audience?

We wanted something that forced deep thought, but was easy to use and maintain. We wanted to force objectivity and data-collection. We wanted a tool that housed product information and that served as a clear communication tool. At Polar, we created a tool that met our needs. We created The Product Canvas.


### The Product Canvas

The Product Canvas is a fast and easy way to communicate product iterations, features, and solutions. It is very much inspired by Ash Maurya’s work on Lean Canvas. However, [where the Lean Canvas helps think through a startup's business model], the Product Canvas helps think about an existing product and its challenges. At its core, it creates a repeatable process around problem solving. Furthermore, it serves as a communication tool between product management, engineering, marketing, and beyond.

The three areas of the Product Canvas are:

1. Persona, Problem and Goals: Here, product managers identify the issue, who it’s affecting, goals and success criteria. It deliberately keeps this top of mind.
2. Solution(s): Product managers will look at existing solutions and begin to fill in the their solution. They will also think through execution, partnerships, and resources if necessary.
3. External: Here, product managers will collect customer feedback and validate the solution. They will think through adoption; both execution and who will adopt the solution first. 


At Polar, the Product Canvas has become the launchpad for product updates and new features. Below, is a depiction with descriptions and use cases.

### The benefits

We’ve seen 3 major benefits to using this tool:

1. Actionable: The ‘Examples’ box forces us to look at industry examples. It acknowledges existing best-in-class solutions. The validation box ignites a product team to bring customers into the fold – to test and validate. Actions on these fronts are core to solving the puzzle.
2. Think broadly, think deeply: The canvas provides areas of input, all the way from problem and persona, to adoption and documentation. This allows us to complete the thought around product upfront and preemptively.
3. Learn, don’t pitch: The canvas keeps persona, problem, goals, and success criteria top of mind. It forces customer validation and research of industry norms. The solution box is deliberately placed in the middle so that it can encompass the information surrounding it. In other words, data drives the solution.


There are clear similarities between this and the Lean Canvas. Yes, we’ve sampled it, and yes it’s worked. I'd love to hear your feedback. I'd love to hear about where this can be improved. I hope it helps you build better products, just like it has for us.

Cheers,
Pratik
