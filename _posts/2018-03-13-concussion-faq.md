There is an area of mental health that hasn't been a focus for anyone not playing football or hockey. It's the concussion and it's an injury that has impacted me. I've learned to take control of my own healthcare.

This past December, I hit my head in a pretty embarrassing way. I jumped a couple of steps as I normally do and hit my head on a low concrete ceiling. Completely self-inflicted.

Turns out, I hit my head hard enough that I bamboozled myself into a concussion. While on vacation, I was nauseous and dizzy. I had a headache. I had light and sound sensitivity. I was constantly tired.

### Grateful

I shut it down for two weeks and went on an aggressive search for a "cure". I spoke to a team of people who had gone through it before. These people proved to be the most helpful. Thank you Kanika, Nikolai, and Michael for the calls, texts, and tips. I'm grateful.

Speaking of people to thank, I have to thank family and friends who checked on me constantly. Of course, I'm especially thankful for Ash - who did everything so I didn't have to. Lucky in love, I guess.

### Understanding

After seeing too many clinicians, I learned that there simply wasn't enough awareness. I also learned to take healthcare into my own hands. I put together a body of research around concussions specifically. I found helpful, and I present it here.

The way I could make sense of what I had learned was that a concussion was really two injuries (if not more).

1.  A brain injury.
2.  Whiplash.

The concussion FAQ is split into three sections:

* Concussion, the traumatic brain injury (TBI)
* Concussion, the whiplash
* Concussion statistics

Hope that you're able to read it and learn more about concussions, the risks, and the severity of the injury.

Thanks.
