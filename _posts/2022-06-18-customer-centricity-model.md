Let's dive headfirst into a concept that's close to every product leader's heart – customer centricity. Just as we build maturity models to navigate growth and set expectations, we've crafted a unique framework that'll be your compass on the journey to customer-centric success. It's called the Customer Centricity Maturity Model.

At the core of this model lies a truth we hold dear: Competency and growth are beautifully interlinked. So, whether you're a rookie or a seasoned pro, buckle up as we unveil the stages of customer centricity and how they guide us to reach for the stars.

# The Four Stages of Customer Centricity

## Lack of Empathy:
At this stage, it's like we're navigating a foggy sea without a compass. We lack clarity about our users, their segments, and their fundamental needs. It's as if we're dancing in the dark, struggling to find our rhythm.

## Empathy:
Ah, the stage of enlightenment! We're beginning to understand our users, their needs, and we're consistently striving to solve their present-day challenges. It's like shining a light on the path ahead, making progress one step at a time.

## Embodiment:
We've crossed a significant milestone here. We not only understand our users intellectually, but we're also tapping into their emotions. We feel their pain, their struggles, and we're committed to delivering solutions predictably. This stage is all about forging a deeper connection.

## Leadership:
This is the summit we aspire to reach. We harness the power of data, expertise, and our profound understanding of customers to guide them towards a brighter future. Our leadership becomes a beacon, lighting the way to unexplored possibilities.

# Mapping the Journey: Axes of Growth
To visualize our journey, we've mapped these stages across two axes – Commercial Value and Internal/External Focus. As we ascend towards leadership, we embrace the external focus that aligns with substantial commercial value. Conversely, lacking empathy often results from an internal focus and can lead to ineffective customer outcomes.

## The Heat Map of Expertise
The beauty of this model lies in its ability to create a heat map of expertise across maturity levels. It's the interplay of roles, functions, and stages that defines our organizational grade.

The devil may be in the details, but the magic is in the framework. With the Customer Centricity Maturity Model, we're not just building products – we're crafting experiences, nurturing connections, and leading the way towards unparalleled success.

So, my fellow product trailblazers, let's embrace empathy, embody our users' experiences, and lead them to horizons yet uncharted. This is the journey that defines us. This is the journey that propels Hubdoc forward.
