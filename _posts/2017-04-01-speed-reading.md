Between the never-ending abyss of content on the Internet and the always-expanding list of must-read books, consuming enough content is a challenge. At work, I look at the 2017-resolution wall, and
read more" is plastered all over it. One step I took to take on the resolution was to read faster. Naturally, I bought in on the idea of speed-reading.

How did I learn to speed-read?  It started with a goal of reading more.  I was reading about eight books a year and wanted to move to 12 (now on pace for 15).  I had watched the speed-reading infomercials on TV [in the 90s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I54q6yeV8B0) and was looking for something less preposterous.  The average adult reads about 250 words per minute, and [Tim Ferriss](http://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/)&#39; blog claimed I could become one of the 1% that can read 400 words per minute.

### Online Content

For online content, I discovered that the Instapaper app, which I had already been using to save articles, had a speed-reading setting. This was game changing for my online content consumption. I&#39;m spending half the time reading articles and retaining SO MUCH MORE. The app flashes a single word in a single location on screen so you never have to shift your eyes or scroll.

Instapaper also has a desktop web app (which I've wrapped with [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) so I can open it as an app on my macbook.) Now I scroll through my 500+ content backlog and deep dive on special themes or ideas. I'll read 1-5 articles on a single topic in about 10-20 minutes. Gone are the days of aimless content consumption.

### Books

I applied [Tim Ferriss&#39; techniques](mailto:http://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/) to learn how to speed-read books, which took 20 minutes of reading and a lot of practice.  Essentially, he suggests the same techniques that helped me with online content -- limiting the amount of eye per line read. After four weeks, I discovered that I was learning faster, and retaining a lot more information with books as well.

It turns out that eliminating eye movements to read faster is already well understood by neuroscientists.  A type of visual presentation called RSVP, or Rapid Serial Visual Processing, displays words sequentially, one after another, in the same place in the visual field (i.e., on a computer screen right in front of you) so that eye movements are not required to read the words.  Participants reading with the RSVP presentation improve their reading speed by threefold, compared to normal reading styles (Dehaene, 2009).

What did I learn from my experience with speed-reading?  First, it takes focus.  You must eliminate distractions.  Task-switching has a terrible impact on your productivity.  Second, reading speed is limited primarily by the biomechanics of the eye.  You can only read as quickly as your eyes can move, but your brain can process at a faster rate than your eyes move.  Therefore, if you speed up the rate at which you can see words without requiring eye movements, you can read a lot more words in less time.

Speed-reading has helped me in several ways.  I now learn faster and retain more, though it now takes a deliberate focus.  Since I now read faster, I have more time to read books and can commit to reading a book over a week rather than slowly over several months.  Speed-reading allows you to understand the broad strokes and highlights, but also focus on the details -- the forest beyond the trees. I&#39;m seeing the details, and understanding how the pieces fit in a much better way.
