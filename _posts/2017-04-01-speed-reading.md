There's too much content.

A never-ending abyss of articles on the Internet and an always-expanding list of must-read books keeps me challenged to keep up. I have over 500 articles saved on Instapaper, an ever-growing 'to-do list'. I read about eight books a year. At work, I look at the 2017-resolution wall, and "read more" is plastered all over it.

It was due time; I decided to read faster.

 I had watched the speed-reading infomercials on TV [in the 90s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I54q6yeV8B0) and yes, I was looking for those same results (I was bought in). Then I read about how Tim Ferriss learned to speed-read.  The average adult reads about 250 words per minute, and [his blog](http://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/)&#39; claimed I could become one of the 1% that can read 400 words per minute.

## Here's how I did it

### Online Content

For online content, I discovered that the Instapaper app, which I had already been using to save articles, had a speed-reading setting. This was game changing for my online content consumption. I&#39;m spending half the time reading articles and retaining SO MUCH MORE. The app flashes a single word in a single location on screen so you never have to shift your eyes or scroll.

Instapaper also has a desktop web app (which I've wrapped with [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) so I can open it as an app on my macbook.) Now I scroll through my 500+ content backlog and deep dive on special themes or ideas. I'll read 1-5 articles on a single topic in about 10-20 minutes. Gone are the days of aimless content consumption.

### Books

I applied [Tim Ferriss&#39; techniques](mailto:http://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/) to learn how to speed-read books, which took 20 minutes of reading and a lot of practice.  Essentially, he suggests the same techniques that helped me with online content -- limiting the amount of eye per line read. After four weeks, I discovered that I was learning faster, and retaining a lot more information with books as well.

It turns out that eliminating eye movements to read faster is already well understood by neuroscientists.  A type of visual presentation called RSVP, or Rapid Serial Visual Processing, displays words sequentially, one after another, in the same place in the visual field (i.e., on a computer screen right in front of you) so that eye movements are not required to read the words.  Participants reading with the RSVP presentation improve their reading speed by threefold, compared to normal reading styles (Dehaene, 2009).

What did I learn from my experience with speed-reading?  First, it takes focus.  You must eliminate distractions.  Task-switching has a terrible impact on your productivity.  Second, reading speed is limited primarily by the biomechanics of the eye.  You can only read as quickly as your eyes can move, but your brain can process at a faster rate than your eyes move.  Therefore, if you speed up the rate at which you can see words without requiring eye movements, you can read a lot more words in less time.

Speed-reading has helped me in several ways.  I now learn faster and retain more, though it now takes a deliberate focus.  Since I now read faster, I have more time to read books and can commit to reading a book over a week rather than slowly over several months.  Speed-reading allows you to understand the broad strokes and highlights, but also focus on the details -- the forest beyond the trees. I&#39;m seeing the details, and understanding how the pieces fit in a much better way.
